uid: microsoft.quantum.canon.binda
name: BindA
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: |-
  Given an array of operations acting on a single input,
  produces a new operation that
  performs each given operation in sequence.
  The modifier `A` indicates that all operations in the array are adjointable.
examples: |-
  The following are equivalent:

  ```qsharp
  let bound = Bind([U, V]);
  bound(x);
  ```

  and

  ```qsharp
  U(x); V(x);
  ```
syntax: "function BindA (operations : ('T => Unit : Adjoint)[]) : ('T => Unit : Adjoint)"
input:
  content: "(operations : ('T => Unit : Adjoint)[])"
  types:
  - name: operations
    summary: A sequence of operations to be performed on a given input.
