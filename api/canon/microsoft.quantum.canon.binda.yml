name: BindA
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: >2
   Given an array of operations acting on a single input,
   produces a new operation that
   performs each given operation in sequence.
   The modifier 'A' indicates that all operations in the array are adjointable.
remarks: >2

  ### Examples
   The following are equivalent:
   ```Q#
   let bound = Bind([U; V]);
   bound(x);

   U(x); V(x);
   ```
syntax: "function BindA (operations : ('T => () : Adjoint)[]) : ('T => () : Adjoint)"
input:
  content: "(operations : ('T => () : Adjoint)[])"
  types:
  - name: operations
    summary: >2
       A sequence of operations to be performed on a given input.
    isArray: true
    isOperation: true
    input:
      uid: "'T"
      isLocal: true
    output:
      uid: ()
      isPrimitive: true
    functors: &o0
    - Adjoint
output:
  content: "('T => () : Adjoint)"
  types:
  - summary: >2
       A new operation that performs each given operation in sequence
       on its input.
    isOperation: true
    input:
      uid: "'T"
      isLocal: true
    output:
      uid: ()
      isPrimitive: true
    functors: *o0
