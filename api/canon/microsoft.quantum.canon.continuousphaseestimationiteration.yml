summary: >2
   Performs a single iteration of an iterative (classically-controlled) phase
   estimation algorithm using arbitrary real powers of a unitary oracle.

       Operation acting on a double $t$ and a register,
       such that $U^t$ is applied to the given register, where $U$ is the unitary
       whose phase is to be estimated, and where $t$ is the integer power
       given to the oracle
