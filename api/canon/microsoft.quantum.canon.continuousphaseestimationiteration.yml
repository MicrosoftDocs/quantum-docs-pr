summary: |-
  Performs a single iteration of an iterative (classically-controlled) phase
  estimation algorithm using arbitrary real powers of a unitary oracle.
syntax: 'operation ContinuousPhaseEstimationIteration (oracle : Microsoft.Quantum.Canon.ContinuousOracle, time : Double, theta : Double, targetState : Qubit[], controlQubit : Qubit) : Unit'

  - name: oracle
    summary: |-
      Operation acting on a double $t$ and a register,
      such that $U^t$ is applied to the given register, where $U$ is the unitary
      whose phase is to be estimated, and where $t$ is the integer power
      given to the oracle
