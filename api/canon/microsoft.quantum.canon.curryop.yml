namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: >2
   Given an operation with two inputs, applies Curry's isomorphism
   $f(x, y) \equiv f(x)(y)$ to return an operation of one input which
   returns an operation of one input.
remarks: >2-
   The following are equivalent:
   ```qsharp
   op(x, y);

   let curried = CurryOp(op);
   let partial = curried(x);
   partial(y);
   ```
syntax: "function CurryOp (op : (('T, 'U) => ())) : ('T -> ('U => ()))"
input:
  content: "(op : (('T, 'U) => ()))"
  types:
  - name: op
    summary: >2
       An operation whose input is a pair.
    isOperation: true
    input:
      types:
      - uid: "'T"
        isLocal: true
      - uid: "'U"
        isLocal: true
    output:
      types:
      - uid: ()
        isPrimitive: true
output:
  content: ('T -> ('U => ()))
  types:
  - summary: >2
       An operation which accepts the first element of a pair and returns
       an operation which accepts as its input the second element of the
       original operation's input.
