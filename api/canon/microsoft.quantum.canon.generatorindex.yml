type: newtype
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: >-
  Represents a single primitive term in the set of all dynamical generators, e.g.
  Hermitian operators, for which there exists a map from that generator
  to time-evolution by that that generator, through `EvolutionSet`.

  The first element
  (Int[], Double[]) is indexes that single term -- For instance, the Pauli string
  XXY with coefficient 0.5 would be indexed by ([1,1,2], [0.5]). Alternatively,
  Hamiltonians parameterized by a continuous variable, such as X cos φ + Y sin φ,
  might for instance be represented by ([], [φ]). The second
  element indexes the subsystem on which the generator acts on.

  ### Examples
  Using  <xref:microsoft.quantum.canon.paulievolutionset>, the operator
  $\pi X_2 X_5 Y_9$ is represented as:

  ```qsharp
  let index = GeneratorIndex(([1, 1, 2], [PI()]), [2, 5, 9]);
  ```
syntax: newtype GeneratorIndex = ((Int[], Double[]), Int[]);
