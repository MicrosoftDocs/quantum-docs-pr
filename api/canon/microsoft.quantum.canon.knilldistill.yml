   Given 15 approximate copies of a magic state
   $$
   \begin{align}
       \cos\frac{\pi}{8} \ket{0} + \sin \frac{\pi}{8} \ket{1}.
   \end{align},
   $$ yields one higher-quality copy.
remarks: >2
   We follow the algorithm of Knill.
   However, the present implementation is far from being optimal,
   as it uses too many qubits.
   The magic states are injected in this routine,
   in which case there are better protocols.

       If `true`, then the procedure succeeded and the higher-quality
       copy should be accepted. If `false`, the procedure failed, and
       the state of the register should be considered undefined.
