type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: >2
   Measures the identity operator $\boldone$ on a register
   of qubits.
remarks: >2-
   Since $\boldone$ has only the eigenvalue $1$, and does not
   have a negative eigenvalue, this operation always returns
   `Zero`, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+1 = (-1)^0$,
   and does not cause a collapse of the state of `register`.

   On its own, this operation is not useful, but is helpful
   in the context of process tomography, as it provides
   information about the trace preservation of a quantum process.
   In particular, a target machine with lossy measurement should
   replace this operation by an actual measurement of $\boldone$.
