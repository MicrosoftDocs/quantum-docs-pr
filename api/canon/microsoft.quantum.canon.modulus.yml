name: Modulus
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: Computes the canonical residue of `value` modulo `modulus`.
remarks: |-
  This function behaves different to how the operator `%` behaves in C# and Q# as in the result
  is always a positive integer between 0 and `modulus - 1`, even if value is negative.
