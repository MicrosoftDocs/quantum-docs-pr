summary: |-
  Prepares a qubit in the +1 (`Zero`) eigenstate of the given Pauli operator.
  If the identity operator is given, then the qubit is prepared in the maximally
  mixed state.

  That is, given a single qubit initially in the $\ket{0}$ state, prepares the
  qubit in the $+1$ eigenstate of a given Pauli operator, or in the
  maximally mixed state for the $\boldone$ Pauli operator `PauliI`.
