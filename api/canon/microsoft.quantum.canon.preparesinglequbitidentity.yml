summary: >2
   Given a qubit, prepares that qubit in the maximally mixed
   state $\boldone / 2$ by applying the depolarizing channel
   $$
   \begin{align}
       \Omega(\rho) \mathrel{:=} \frac{1}{4} \sum_{\mu \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\}} \sigma\_{\mu} \rho \sigma\_{\mu}^{\dagger},
   \end{align}
   $$
   where $\sigma\_i$ is the $i$th Pauli operator, and where
   $\rho$ is a density operator representing a mixed state.
remarks: >2-
   The mixed state $\boldone / 2$ describing the result of
   applying this operation to a state implicitly describes
   an expectation value over random choices made in this operation.
   Thus, for any single application, this operation maps pure states
   to pure states, but it acts as described in expectation.
   In particular, this operation can be used in process tomography
   to measure the *non-unital* components of a channel.
