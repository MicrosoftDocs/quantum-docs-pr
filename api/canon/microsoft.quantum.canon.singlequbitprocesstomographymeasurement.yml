summary: |-
  Performs a single-qubit process tomography measurement in the Pauli
  basis, given a particular channel of interest.
remarks: |-
  The distribution over results returned by this operation is a special
  case of two-qubit state tomography. Let $\rho = J(\Lambda) / 2$ be
  the Choi–Jamiłkowski state for $\Lambda$. Then, the distribution above
  is identical to
  $$
  \begin{align}
  \Pr(\texttt{Zero} | \rho; M) = \operatorname{Tr}(M \rho),
  \end{align}
  $$
  where $M = 2 (\boldone + P)^\mathrm{T} / 2 \cdot (\boldone + Q) / 2$
  is the effective measurement corresponding to $P$ and $Q$.
