uid: microsoft.quantum.canon.with
name: With
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: >-
  Given operations implementing operators `U` and `V`, performs the
  operation `U†VU` on a target. That is, this operation
  conjugates `V` with `U`.
remarks: >-
  The outer operation is always assumed to be adjointable, but does not
  need to be controllable in order for the combined operation to be
  controllable.
syntax: "operation With (outerOperation : ('T => Unit : Adjoint), innerOperation : ('T => Unit), target : 'T) : Unit"
input:
  content: "(outerOperation : ('T => Unit : Adjoint), innerOperation : ('T => Unit), target : 'T)"
  types:
  - name: outerOperation
    summary: >-
      The operation $U$ that should be used to conjugate $V$. Note that the
      outer operation $U$ needs to be adjointable, but does not
      need to be controllable.
