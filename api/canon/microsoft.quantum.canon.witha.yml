type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: >2
   Given operations implementing operators $U$ and $V$, performs the
   operation $UVU^{\dagger}$ on a target. That is, this operation
   conjugates $V$ with $U$.
   The modifier 'A' indicates that the inner operation is adjointable.
remarks: >2
   The outer operation is always assumed to be adjointable, but does not
   need to be controllable in order for the combined operation to be
   controllable.

       The operation $U$ that should be used to conjugate $V$. Note that the
       outer operation $U$ needs to be adjointable, but does not
