# `%azure.execute`

## Summary

Submits a job to an Azure Quantum workspace and waits for completion.

## Description

This magic command allows for submitting a Q# operation or function
to be run on the specified target in the current Azure Quantum workspace.
The command waits a specified amount of time for the job to complete before returning.

The Azure Quantum workspace must have been previously initialized
using the [`%azure.connect` magic command](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.connect),
and an execution target for the job must have been specified using the
[`%azure.target` magic command](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.target).

#### Required parameters

- Q# operation or function name. This must be the first parameter, and must be a valid Q# operation
or function name that has been defined either in the notebook or in a Q# file in the same folder.
- Arguments for the Q# operation or function must also be specified as `key=value` pairs.

#### Optional parameters

- `jobName=<string>`: Friendly name to identify this job. If not specified,
the Q# operation or function name will be used as the job name.
- `shots=<integer>` (default=500): Number of times to repeat execution of the
specified Q# operation or function.
- `timeout=<integer>` (default=30): Time to wait (in seconds) for job completion
before the magic command returns.
- `poll=<integer>` (default=5): Interval (in seconds) to poll for
job status while waiting for job execution to complete.

#### Possible errors

- `NotConnected`: Not connected to any Azure Quantum workspace.
- `NoTarget`: No execution target has been configured for Azure Quantum job submission.
- `NoOperationName`: No Q# operation name was specified for Azure Quantum job submission.
- `InvalidTarget`: The specified execution target is not valid for Q# job submission in the current Azure Quantum workspace.
- `UnrecognizedOperationName`: The specified Q# operation name was not recognized.
- `InvalidEntryPoint`: The specified Q# operation cannot be used as an entry point for Azure Quantum job submission.
- `JobSubmissionFailed`: Failed to submit the job to the Azure Quantum workspace.
- `JobNotCompleted`: The specified Azure Quantum job has not yet completed.
- `JobOutputDownloadFailed`: Failed to download results for the specified Azure Quantum job.

## Examples for `%azure.execute`

### Example 1

Run a Q# operation defined as `operation MyOperation(a : Int, b : Int) : Result`
on the active target in the current Azure Quantum workspace:
```
In []: %azure.execute MyOperation a=5 b=10
Out[]: Submitting MyOperation to target provider.qpu...
       Job successfully submitted for 500 shots.
          Job name: MyOperation
          Job ID: <Azure Quantum job ID>
       Waiting up to 30 seconds for Azure Quantum job to complete...
       [1:23:45 PM] Current job status: Waiting
       [1:23:50 PM] Current job status: Executing
       [1:23:55 PM] Current job status: Succeeded
       <detailed results of completed job>
```

### Example 2

Run a Q# operation defined as `operation MyOperation(a : Int, b : Int) : Result`
on the active target in the current Azure Quantum workspace,
specifying a custom job name, number of shots, timeout, and polling interval:
```
In []: %azure.submit MyOperation a=5 b=10 jobName="My job" shots=100 timeout=60 poll=10
Out[]: Submitting MyOperation to target provider.qpu...
       Job successfully submitted for 100 shots.
          Job name: My job
          Job ID: <Azure Quantum job ID>
       Waiting up to 60 seconds for Azure Quantum job to complete...
       [1:23:45 PM] Current job status: Waiting
       [1:23:55 PM] Current job status: Waiting
       [1:24:05 PM] Current job status: Executing
       [1:24:15 PM] Current job status: Succeeded
       <detailed results of completed job>
```
