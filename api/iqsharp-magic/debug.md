## Description

This magic command allows for stepping through the execution of a given Q# operation
or function using the QuantumSimulator.

#### Required parameters

or function name that has been defined either in the notebook or in a Q# file in the same folder.
- Arguments for the Q# operation or function must also be specified as `key=value` pairs.

## Examples for `%debug`

In []: %debug MyOperation
Out[]: <interactive HTML for stepping through the operation>
```

### Example 2

Step through the execution of a Q# operation defined as `operation MyOperation(a : Int, b : Int) : Result`:
```
In []: %debug MyOperation a=5 b=10
Out[]: <interactive HTML for stepping through the operation>
```
