# `%package`

## Summary

Provides the ability to load a NuGet package.

## Description

This magic command allows for loading a NuGet package into the current IQ# kernel process.
The package must be available on the system's list of NuGet sources, which typically includes nuget.org.
Q# operations, functions, and user-defined types defined in the loaded package,
along with functionality such as magic commands and result encoders,
will automatically become available for use in the current session.

The package can be specified by name only, or by name and version (using `name::version` syntax).

If no version is specified:

- For packages that are part of the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit, IQ# will attempt to
obtain the version of the package that matches the current IQ# version.
- For other packages, IQ# will attempt to obtain the most recent version of the package.

## Example

Load the `Microsoft.Quantum.MachineLearning` package into the current IQ# session:
```
In []: %package Microsoft.Quantum.MachineLearning
Out[]: Adding package Microsoft.Quantum.MachineLearning: done!
       <list of all loaded packages and versions>
```

## Example

Load a specific version of the `Microsoft.Quantum.Katas` package into the current IQ# session:
```
In []: %package Microsoft.Quantum.Katas::0.11.2006.403
Out[]: Adding package Microsoft.Quantum.Katas::0.11.2006.403: done!
       <list of all loaded packages and versions>
```

## Example

View the list of all packages that have been loaded into the current IQ# session:
```
In []: %package
Out[]: <list of all loaded packages and versions>
```
