# `%workspace`

## Summary

Provides actions related to the current workspace.

## Description

This magic command allows for displaying and reloading the Q# operations and functions
defined within .qs files in the current folder.

If no parameters are provided, the command displays a list of Q# operations or functions
within .qs files in the current folder which are available
in the current IQ# session for use with magic commands such as `%simulate`
and `%estimate`.

The command will also output any errors encountered while compiling the .qs files
in the current folder.

#### Optional parameters

- `reload`: Causes the IQ# kernel to recompile all .qs files in the current folder.

## Examples for `%workspace`

### Example 1

Display the list of Q# operations and functions available in the current folder:
```
In []: %workspace
Out[]: <list of Q# operation and function names>
```

### Example 2

Recompile the .qs files in the current folder:
```
In []: %workspace reload
Out[]: <list of Q# operation and function names>
```
