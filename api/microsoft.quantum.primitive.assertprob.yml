type: operation

input:
  bases: >2-

     A measurement effect to assert the probability of, expressed as a
     mutli-qubit Pauli operator.
  qubits: >2-

     A register on which to make the assertion.
  result: >2-

     An expected result of `Measure(bases, qubits)`.
  prob: >2-

     The probability with which the given result is expected.
  msg: >2

     A message to be reported if the assertion fails.
output: {}
summary: >2

   Asserts that measuring the given qubits in the given Pauli basis will have the given result
   with the given probability, within some tolerance.
example: >2

   ```qsharp
   using (register = Qubit[1]) {
       H(register[0]);
       AssertProb([PauliZ], register, One, 0.5,
           "Measuring in conjgate basis did not give 50/50 results.");
   }
   ```
