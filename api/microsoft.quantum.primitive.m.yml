input:
  qubit: >2

     Qubit to be measured.
output: {}
summary: >2

   Performs a measurement of a single qubit in the
   Pauli $Z$ basis, such that the output result is given by
   the distribution
   $$
       \Pr(\texttt{Zero} | \ket{\psi}) =
           \braket{\psi | 0} \braket{0 | \psi}.
   $$
remarks: >2-

   Equivalent to:
   ```qsharp
   Measure([PauliZ], [qubit]);
   ```
syntax: >2-

  operation .M (qubit : Qubit) : Result
