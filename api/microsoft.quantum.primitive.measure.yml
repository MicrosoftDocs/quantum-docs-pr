input:
  bases: >2-

     Array of single-qubit Pauli values indicating the tensor product
     factors on each qubit.
  qubits: >2

     Register of qubits to be measured.
output: {}
summary: >2

   Performs a joint measurement of one or more qubits in the
   specified Pauli bases, such that the output result is given by
   the distribution
   $$
       \Pr(\texttt{Zero} | \ket{\psi}) =
           \frac12 \braket{
               \psi | \boldone + P_0 \otimes P_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes P_N |
               \psi
           },
   $$
   where $P_i$ is the $i$the element of `bases`, and where
   $N = \texttt{Length}(\textt{paulis})$.
   That is, measurement returns a `Result` $d$ such that the eigenvalue of the
   observed measurement effect is $(-1)^d$.
remarks: >2-

   If the basis array and qubit array are different lengths, then the
   operation will fail.
syntax: >2-
