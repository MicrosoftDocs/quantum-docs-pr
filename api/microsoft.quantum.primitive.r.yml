input:
  pauli: >2-

     Pauli operator to be exponentiated to form the rotation.
  theta: >2-

     Angle about which the qubit is to be rotated.
  qubit: >2

     Qubit to which the gate should be applied.
output: {}
summary: >2

   Applies a rotation about the given Pauli axis,
   $$
       R_{\mu}(\theta) \mathrel{:=}
       e^{-i \theta \sigma_{\mu} / 2),
   $$
   where $\mu \in \{I, X, Y, Z\}$.
remarks: >2-

   When called with `pauli = PauliI`, this operation applies
   a *global phase*. This phase can be significant, however,
   when used with the `Controlled` functor.
syntax: >2-
