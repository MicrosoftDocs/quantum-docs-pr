type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive
input:
  numerator: >2-

     Numerator in the dyadic fraction representation of the angle
     by which the qubit is to be rotated.
  power: >2-

     Power of two specifying the denominator of the angle by which
     the qubit is to be rotated.
  qubit: >2

     Qubit to which the gate should be applied.
output: {}
summary: >2

   Applies a rotation about the $\ket{1}$ state by an angle specified
   as a dyadic fraction,
   $$
       R_1(n, k) \mathrel{:=}
       \operatorname{diag}(1, e^{i \pi k / 2^n}).
   $$

remarks: >2-

   Equivalent to:
   ```qsharp
   RFrac(PauliZ, -numerator, denominator + 1, qubit);
   RFrac(PauliI, numerator, denominator + 1, qubit);
   ```
syntax: >2-
