   Dumps the current target machine's status.
remarks: " This method allows you to dump information about the current status of the \n target machine into a file or some other location.\n The actual information generated and the semantics of `location` \n are specific to each target machine. However, providing an empty location (`()`)\n typically means to generate the output to the console.\n \n For the local full state simulator distributed as part of the \n Quantum Development Kit, this method  expects a string with \n the path to a file in which it will write the wavefunction as a\n one-dimensional array of complex numbers, in which each element represents\n the amplituted of the probability of measuring the corresponding state."
