uid: microsoft.quantum.extensions.diagnostics.dumpregister
name: DumpRegister
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Extensions.Diagnostics
summary: Dumps the current target machine's status associated with the given qubits.
remarks: |-
  This method allows you to dump the information associated with the state of the
  given qubits into a file or some other location.
  The actual information generated and the semantics of `location`
  are specific to each target machine. However, providing an empty location (`()`)
  typically means to generate the output to the console.

  For the local full state simulator distributed as part of the
  Quantum Development Kit, this method  expects a string with
  the path to a file in which it will write the
  state of the given qubits (i.e. the wavefunction of the corresponding  subsystem) as a
  one-dimensional array of complex numbers, in which each element represents
  the amplituted of the probability of measuring the corresponding state.
  If the given qubits are entangled with some other qubit and their
  state can't be separated, it just reports that the qubits are entangled.
