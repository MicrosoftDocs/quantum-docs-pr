type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive
summary: >2
   The random operation takes an array of doubles as input, and returns
   a randomly-selected index into the array as an `Int`.
   The probability of selecting a specific index is proportional to the value
   of the array element at that index.
   Array elements that are equal to zero are ignored and their indices are never
   returned. If any array element is less than zero,
   or if no array element is greater than zero, then the operation fails.

       An integer $i$ with probability $\Pr(i) = p_i / \sum_i p_i$, where $p_i$
       is the $i$th element of `probs`.
