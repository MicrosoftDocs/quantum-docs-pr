   # Summary
   This namespace contains functions and operations for performing amplitude
   amplification.

   # Description
   Oblivious amplitude amplification with partial reflections is the most
   general form of amplitude amplification implemented here.

   This is called through the operation AmpAmpObliviousByReflectionPhases.

   This has two registers: `ancillaRegister` and `systemRegister`.

   This accepts two oracles for these reflections of type
   `ReflectionOracle` which act only on the `ancillaRegister`
   register.

   This accepts an oracle special to oblivious amplitude
   amplification of type `ObliviousOracle` which acts jointly
   on both register.

   The input state to `ancillaRegister` is assumed to be the unique
   $-1$ eigenstate of the first reflection operator $I - 2\ket{s}\bra{s}$.

   Reflections about a target quantum state are often implemented by
   assuming access to an oracle that prepare that state from the
   computational basis $\ket{0\cdots 0}$.

   Our convention for these oracles requires two registers: a
   single-qubit `flagQubit` register, and a register for everything
   else on the ancillaRegister register.

   The oracle of type `StateOracle` acts jointly on both registers to
   create the target state flagged by $\ket{1}$ in the `flagQubit`
   register with some real amplitude.

   The reflection `ReflectionOracle` about the this flag state is
   generated by the operation `TargetStateReflectionOracle`.

   The reflection `ReflectionOracle` about the input state to
   `ancillaRegister` is generated by the inverting StateOracle and
   then reflecting about $\ket{0\cdots 0}$ with ReflectionStart().

   The oracle of type `DeterministicStateOracle` acts on the
   `qubitState` registers to create the target state exactly with no
   flag.

   `AmpAmpObliviousByOraclePhases` is a version of oblivious amplitude
   amplification that accepts oracles `StateOracle` and `ObliviousOracle`
   instead of reflections.

   Note that amplitude amplification is a special case of oblivious
   amplitude amplification where `ObliviousOracle` is the identity operator,
   and there are no system qubits i.e. `systemRegister` is empty.

   This is called through the operation `AmpAmByReflectionPhases` and
   `AmpAmpByOraclePhases`.

   The phases for partial reflections in the standard case of Grover
   search is provided by the function AmpAmpPhasesStandard.

   For instance, we have the following dependencies: AmpAmpByOracle ->
   AmpAmpByOraclePhases -> AmpAmpObliviousByOraclePhases ->
   AmpAmpObliviousByReflectionPhases.
