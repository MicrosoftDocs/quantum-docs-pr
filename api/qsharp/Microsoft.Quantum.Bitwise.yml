uid: microsoft.quantum.bitwise
name: Microsoft.Quantum.Bitwise
functions:
- uid: microsoft.quantum.bitwise.and
  summary: |-
    Returns the bitwise AND of two integers.
    This performs the same computation as the built-in `&&&` operator.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.bitwise.leftshiftedi
  summary: |-
    Shifts the bitwise representation of a number left by a given number of
    bits.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.bitwise.leftshiftedl
  summary: |-
    Shifts the bitwise representation of a number left by a given number of
    bits.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.bitwise.not
  summary: |-
    Returns the bitwise NOT of an integer.
    This performs the same computation as the built-in `~~~` operator.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.bitwise.or
  summary: |-
    Returns the bitwise OR of two integers.
    This performs the same computation as the built-in `|||` operator.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.bitwise.parity
  summary: Returns the bitwise PARITY of an integer (1 if its binary representation contains odd number of ones and 0 otherwise).
- uid: microsoft.quantum.bitwise.rightshiftedi
  summary: |-
    Shifts the bitwise representation of a number right by a given number of
    bits.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.bitwise.rightshiftedl
  summary: |-
    Shifts the bitwise representation of a number right by a given number of
    bits.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.bitwise.xbits
  summary: |-
    Returns an integer representing the X bits of an array
    of Pauli operators.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.bitwise.xor
  summary: |-
    Returns the bitwise exclusive-OR (XOR) of two integers.
    This performs the same computation as the built-in `^^^` operator.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.bitwise.zbits
  summary: |-
    Returns an integer representing the Z bits of an array
    of Pauli operators.
