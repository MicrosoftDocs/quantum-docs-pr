   # Summary
   This namespace contains functions and operations for learning properties of
   quantum states and processes, including tomography and phase estimation.
functions: []
operations:
- uid: microsoft.quantum.characterization.continuousphaseestimationiteration
  summary: |-
    Performs a single iteration of an iterative (classically-controlled) phase
    estimation algorithm using arbitrary real powers of a unitary oracle.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.characterization.discretephaseestimationiteration
  summary: |-
    Performs a single iteration of an iterative (classically-controlled) phase
    estimation algorithm using integer powers of a unitary oracle.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.characterization.estimatefrequency
  summary: |-
    Given a preparation and measurement, estimates the frequency
    with which that measurement succeeds (returns `Zero`) by
    performing a given number of trials.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.characterization.measureallz
  summary: |-
    Jointly measures a register of qubits in the Pauli Z basis.

    In other words, measures the operation $Z \otimes Z \otimes \cdots \otimes Z$ on
    a given register.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.characterization.measureidentity
  summary: |-
    Measures the identity operator on a register
    of qubits.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.characterization.quantumphaseestimation
  summary: |-
    Performs the quantum phase estimation algorithm for a given oracle `U` and `targetState`,
    reading the phase into a big-endian quantum register.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.characterization.robustphaseestimation
  summary: |-
    Performs the robust non-iterative quantum phase estimation algorithm for a given oracle `U` and eigenstate,
    and provides a single real-valued estimate of the phase with variance scaling at the Heisenberg limit.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.characterization.singlequbitprocesstomographymeasurement
  summary: |-
    Performs a single-qubit process tomography measurement in the Pauli
    basis, given a particular channel of interest.
