operations:
- uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.assertallzero
  summary: Assert that given qubits are all in $\ket{0}$ state.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.assertallzerowithintolerance
  summary: Assert that given qubits are all in $\ket{0}$ state up to a given tolerance.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.assertoperationsequalinplace
  summary: |-
    Given two operations, asserts that they act identically for all input states.

    This assertion is implemented by checking the action of the operations
    on all states of the form $V_0 \otimes ... \otimes V_{n-1}$, where
    $V_k$ is one of the states $\ket{0}$, $\ket{1}$, $\ket{+}$ and $\ket{i}$ (+1 eigenstate of Pauli Y operator).

    This assertion uses $n$ qubits and requires multiple calls of the operations being compared.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.assertoperationsequalinplacecompbasis
  summary: |-
    Checks if the operation `givenU` is equal to the operation `expectedU` on
    the given input size  by checking the action of the operations only on
    the vectors from the computational basis.
    This is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the equality of
    two unitaries.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.assertoperationsequalreferenced
  summary: |-
    Given two operations, asserts that they act identically for all input states.

    This assertion is implemented by using the Choi–Jamiłkowski isomorphism to reduce
    the assertion to one of a qubit state assertion on two entangled registers.
    Thus, this operation needs only a single call to each operation being tested,
    but requires twice as many qubits to be allocated.
    This assertion can be used to ensure, for instance, that an optimized version of an
    operation acts identically to its naïve implementation, or that an operation
    which acts on a range of non-quantum inputs agrees with known cases.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.assertqubit
  summary: Asserts that the qubit `q` is in the expected eigenstate of the Pauli Z operator.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.assertqubitisinstatewithintolerance
  summary: |-
    Asserts that a qubit in the expected state.

    `expected` represents a complex vector, $\ket{\psi} = \begin{bmatrix}a & b\end{bmatrix}^{\mathrm{T}}$.
    The first element of the tuples representing each of $a$, $b$
    is the real part of the complex number, while the second one is the imaginary part.
    The last argument defines the tolerance with which assertion is made.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.assertqubitwithintolerance
  summary: |-
    Asserts that the qubit `q` is in the expected eigenstate of the Pauli Z operator up to
    a given tolerance.

- uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.equalityfactb
  summary: Asserts that a classical Bool variable has the expected value.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.equalityfacti
  summary: Asserts that a classical Int variable has the expected value.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.equalityfactr
  summary: Asserts that a classical Result variable has the expected value.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.equalitywithintolerancefact
  summary: |-
    Represents the claim that a classical floating point value has the
    expected value up to a given
    absolute tolerance.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.fact
  summary: Declares that a classical condition is true.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.nearequalityfact
  summary: |-
    Asserts that a classical floating point variable has the expected value up to a
    small tolerance of 1e-10.
