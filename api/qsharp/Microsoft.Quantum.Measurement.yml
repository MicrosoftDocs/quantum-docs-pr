operations:
- uid: microsoft.quantum.measurement.measureallz
  summary: Jointly measures a register of qubits in the Pauli Z basis.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.measurement.measurepaulis
  summary: |-
    Given an array of multi-qubit Pauli operators, measures each using a specified measurement
    gadget, then returns the array of results.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.measurement.measurewithscratch
  summary: |-
    Measures the given Pauli operator using an explicit scratch
    qubit to perform the measurement.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.measurement.mresetx
  summary: |-
    Measures a single qubit in the X basis,
    and resets it to the standard basis state
    |0〉 following the measurement.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.measurement.mresety
  summary: |-
    Measures a single qubit in the Y basis,
    and resets it to the standard basis state
    |0〉 following the measurement.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.measurement.mresetz
  summary: |-
    Measures a single qubit in the `Z` basis,
    and resets it to the standard basis state
    |0〉 following the measurement.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.measurement.multim
  summary: Measures each qubit in a given array in the standard basis.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.measurement.settobasisstate
  summary: |-
    Sets a qubit to a given computational basis state by measuring the
    qubit and applying a bit flip if needed.
