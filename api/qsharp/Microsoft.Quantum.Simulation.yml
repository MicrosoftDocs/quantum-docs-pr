functions:
- uid: microsoft.quantum.simulation.addgeneratorsystems
  summary: Adds two `GeneratorSystem`s to create a new `GeneratorSystem`.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.simulation.blockencodingbylcu
  summary: |-
    Encodes an operator of interest into a `BlockEncoding`.

    This constructs a `BlockEncoding` unitary $U=P\cdot V\cdot P^\dagger$ that encodes some
    operator $H=\sum_{j}|\alpha_j|U_j$ of interest that is a linear combination of
    unitaries. Typically, $P$ is a state preparation unitary such that
    $P\ket{0}\_a=\sum_j\sqrt{\alpha_j/\|\vec\alpha\|\_2}\ket{j}\_a$,
    and $V=\sum_{j}\ket{j}\bra{j}\_a\otimes U_j$.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.simulation.blockencodingreflectionbylcu
  summary: |-
    Encodes an operator of interest into a `BlockEncodingReflection`.

    This constructs a `BlockEncodingReflection` unitary $U=P\cdot V\cdot P^\dagger$ that encodes some
    operator $H=\sum_{j}|\alpha_j|U_j$ of interest that is a linear combination of
    unitaries. Typically, $P$ is a state preparation unitary such that
    $P\ket{0}\_a\sum_j\sqrt{\alpha_j/\|\vec\alpha\|\_2}\ket{j}\_a$,
    and $V=\sum_{j}\ket{j}\bra{j}\_a\otimes U_j$.
- uid: microsoft.quantum.simulation.blockencodingtoreflection
  summary: |-
    Converts a `BlockEncoding` into an equivalent `BLockEncodingReflection`.

    That is, given a `BlockEncoding` unitary $U$ that encodes some
    operator $H$ of interest, converts it into a `BlockEncodingReflection` $U'$ that
    encodes the same operator, but also satisfies $U'^\dagger = U'$.
    This increases the size of the auxiliary register of $U$ by one qubit.

    interest that acts on the system register `s` is encoded in the top-
    left block corresponding to auxiliary state $\ket{0}_a$. That is,

    $$

    Represents a set of gates that can be readily implemented and used
    to implement simulation algorithms.

    Elements in the set are indexed
    by a  <xref:microsoft.quantum.simulation.generatorindex>,
    and each set is described by a function
    from `GeneratorIndex` to  <xref:microsoft.quantum.simulation.evolutionunitary>,

  summary: |-
    Represents a single primitive term in the set of all dynamical generators, e.g.
    Hermitian operators, for which there exists a map from that generator
    to time-evolution by that generator, through `EvolutionSet`.

    The first element
    (Int[], Double[]) is indexes that single term -- For instance, the Pauli string
    XXY with coefficient 0.5 would be indexed by ([1,1,2], [0.5]). Alternatively,
    Hamiltonians parameterized by a continuous variable, such as X cos φ + Y sin φ,
    might for instance be represented by ([], [φ]). The second
    element indexes the subsystem on which the generator acts on.
