## Description

Oblivious amplitude amplification with partial reflections is the mostgeneral form of amplitude amplification implemented here.This is called through the operation AmpAmpObliviousByReflectionPhases.This has two registers: `ancillaRegister` and `systemRegister`.This accepts two oracles for these reflections of type`ReflectionOracle` which act only on the `ancillaRegister`register.This accepts an oracle special to oblivious amplitudeamplification of type `ObliviousOracle` which acts jointlyon both register.The input state to `ancillaRegister` is assumed to be the unique$-1$ eigenstate of the first reflection operator $I - 2\ket{s}\bra{s}$.Reflections about a target quantum state are often implemented byassuming access to an oracle that prepare that state from thecomputational basis $\ket{0\cdots 0}$.Our convention for these oracles requires two registers: asingle-qubit `flagQubit` register, and a register for everythingelse on the ancillaRegister register.The oracle of type `StateOracle` acts jointly on both registers tocreate the target state flagged by $\ket{1}$ in the `flagQubit`register with some real amplitude.The reflection `ReflectionOracle` about the this flag state isgenerated by the operation `TargetStateReflectionOracle`.The reflection `ReflectionOracle` about the input state to`ancillaRegister` is generated by the inverting StateOracle andthen reflecting about $\ket{0\cdots 0}$ with ReflectionStart().The oracle of type `DeterministicStateOracle` acts on the`qubitState` registers to create the target state exactly with noflag.`AmpAmpObliviousByOraclePhases` is a version of oblivious amplitudeamplification that accepts oracles `StateOracle` and `ObliviousOracle`instead of reflections.Note that amplitude amplification is a special case of obliviousamplitude amplification where `ObliviousOracle` is the identity operator,and there are no system qubits i.e. `systemRegister` is empty.This is called through the operation `AmpAmByReflectionPhases` and`AmpAmpByOraclePhases`.The phases for partial reflections in the standard case of Groversearch is provided by the function AmpAmpPhasesStandard.For instance, we have the following dependencies: AmpAmpByOracle ->AmpAmpByOraclePhases -> AmpAmpObliviousByOraclePhases ->AmpAmpObliviousByReflectionPhases.
