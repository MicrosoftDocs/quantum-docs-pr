name: ApplyXorInPlace
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic
summary: |-
  Applies a bitwise-XOR operation between a classical integer and an
  integer represented by a register of qubits.

  Applies `X` operations to qubits in a little-endian register based on
  1 bits in an integer.

  Let us denote `value` by a and let y be an unsigned integer encoded in `target`,
  then `InPlaceXorLE` performs an operation given by the following map:
  $\ket{y}\rightarrow \ket{y\oplus a}$ , where $\oplus$ is the bitwise exclusive OR operator.
