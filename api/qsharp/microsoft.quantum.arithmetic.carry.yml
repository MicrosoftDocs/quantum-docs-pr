uid: microsoft.quantum.arithmetic.carry
name: Carry
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic
summary: |-
  Implements a reversible carry gate. Given a carry-in bit encoded in
  qubit `carryIn` and two summand bits encoded in `summand1` and `summand2`,
  computes the bitwise xor of `carryIn`, `summand1` and `summand2` in the
  qubit `summand2` and the carry-out is xored to the qubit `carryOut`.
syntax: 'operation Carry (carryIn : Qubit, summand1 : Qubit, summand2 : Qubit, carryOut : Qubit) : Unit'
input:
  content: '(carryIn : Qubit, summand1 : Qubit, summand2 : Qubit, carryOut : Qubit)'
  types:
  - name: carryIn
    summary: Carry-in qubit.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Qubit
  - name: summand1
    summary: First summand qubit.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Qubit
  - name: summand2
    summary: |-
      Second summand qubit, is replaced with the lower bit of the sum of
      `summand1` and `summand2`.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Qubit
  - name: carryOut
    summary: Carry-out qubit, will be xored with the higher bit of the sum.
