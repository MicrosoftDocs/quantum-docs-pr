name: CascadeCCNOT
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic
summary: |-
  Implements a cascade of CCNOT gates controlled on corresponding bits of two
  qubit registers, acting on the next qubit of one of the registers.
  Starting from the qubits at position 0 in both registers as controls, CCNOT is
  applied to the qubit at position 1 of the target register, then controlled by
  the qubits at position 1 acting on the qubit at position 2 in the target register,
  etc., ending with an action on the target qubit in position `Length(nQubits)-1`.
remarks: The target qubit register must have one qubit more than the other register.
