name: CascadeCNOT
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic
summary: |-
  Implements a cascade of CNOT gates on neighboring qubits in a given qubit
  register, starting from the qubit at position 0 as control to the qubit at
  position 1 as the target, then from the qubit at position 1 as the control to
  the qubit at position 2 as the target, etc., ending with the qubit in position
  `Length(register)-1` as the target.
