uid: microsoft.quantum.arithmetic.copymostsignificantbit
name: CopyMostSignificantBit
type: operation
namespace: microsoft.quantum.arithmetic
summary: |-
  Copies the most significant bit of a qubit register
  `from` representing an unsigned integer into the qubit `target`.
syntax: 'operation CopyMostSignificantBit (from : Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic.LittleEndian, target : Qubit) : Unit'
input:
  content: '(from : Microsoft.Quantum.Arithmetic.LittleEndian, target : Qubit)'
  types:
  - name: from
    summary: |-
      The unsigned integer from which the highest bit is copied from.
      the integer is encoded in little-endian format.
    uid: microsoft.quantum.arithmetic.littleendian
  - name: target
    summary: |-
      The qubit in which the highest bit is being copied. The bit encoding is
      in computational basis.
