uid: microsoft.quantum.arithmetic.sum
name: Sum
type: operation
namespace: microsoft.quantum.arithmetic
summary: |-
  Implements a reversible sum gate. Given a carry-in bit encoded in
  qubit `carryIn` and two summand bits encoded in `summand1` and `summand2`,
  computes the bitwise xor of `carryIn`, `summand1` and `summand2` in the qubit
  `summand2`.
remarks: In contrast to the `Carry` operation, this does not compute the carry-out bit.
syntax: 'operation Sum (carryIn : Qubit, summand1 : Qubit, summand2 : Qubit) : Unit'
input:
  content: '(carryIn : Qubit, summand1 : Qubit, summand2 : Qubit)'
  types:
  - name: carryIn
    summary: Carry-in qubit.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Qubit
  - name: summand1
    summary: First summand qubit.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Qubit
  - name: summand2
    summary: |-
      Second summand qubit, is replaced with the lower bit of the sum of
      `summand1` and `summand2`.
