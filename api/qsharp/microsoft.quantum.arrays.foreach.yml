type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Arrays
summary: |-
  Given an array and an operation that is defined
  for the elements of the array, returns a new array that consists
  of the images of the original array under the operation.
remarks: |-
  The operation is defined for generic types, i.e., whenever we have
  an array `'T[]` and an operation `action : 'T -> 'U` we can map the elements
  of the array and produce a new array of type `'U[]`.
syntax: "operation ForEach (action : ('T => 'U), array : 'T[]) : 'U[]"
input:
  content: "(action : ('T => 'U), array : 'T[])"
  types:
  - name: action
    summary: An operation from `'T` to `'U` that is applied to each element.

      - uid: "'U"
        isLocal: true
  - name: array

    isArray: true
    uid: "'T"
    isLocal: true
output:
  content: "'U[]"
