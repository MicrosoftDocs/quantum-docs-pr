uid: microsoft.quantum.arrays.issorted
name: IsSorted
type: function
namespace: microsoft.quantum.arrays
summary: |-
  Given an array, returns whether that array is sorted as defined by
  a given comparison function.
remarks: |-
  The function `comparison` is assumed to be transitive, such that
  if `comparison(a, b)` and `comparison(b, c)`, then `comparison(a, c)`
  is assumed. If this property does not hold, then the output of this
  function may be incorrect.
syntax: "function IsSorted (comparison : (('T, 'T) -> Bool), array : 'T[]) : Bool"
input:
  content: "(comparison : (('T, 'T) -> Bool), array : 'T[])"
  types:
  - name: comparison
    summary: |-
      A function that compares two elements such that `a` is considered to
      be less than or equal to `b` if `comparison(a, b)` is `true`.

  types:
  - summary: |-
      `true` if and only if for each pair of elements `a` and `b` of
      `array` occuring in that order, `comparison(a, b)` is `true`.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Bool
typeParameters:
