type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Arrays
summary: |-
  Given an array, returns a function which returns elements of that
  array.
remarks: |-
  This function is mainly useful for interoperating with functions and
  operations that take `Int -> 'T` functions as their arguments. This
  is common, for instance, in the generator representation library,
  where functions are used to avoid the need to record an entire array
  in memory.
