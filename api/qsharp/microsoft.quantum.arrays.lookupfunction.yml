type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Arrays
summary: |-
  Given an array, returns a function which returns elements of that
  array.
remarks: |-
  This function is mainly useful for interoperating with functions and
  operations that take `Int -> 'T` functions as their arguments. This
  is common, for instance, in the generator representation library,
  where functions are used to avoid the need to record an entire array
  in memory.
syntax: "function LookupFunction (array : 'T[]) : (Int -> 'T)"
input:
  content: "(array : 'T[])"
  types:
  - name: array
    summary: The array to be represented as a lookup function.
    isArray: true
    uid: "'T"
    isLocal: true
output:
  content: (Int -> 'T)
  types:
  - summary: A function `f` such that `f(idx) == f[idx]`.
