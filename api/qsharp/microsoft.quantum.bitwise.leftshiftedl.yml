name: LeftShiftedL
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Bitwise
summary: |-
  Shifts the bitwise representation of a number left by a given number of
  bits.
remarks: |-
  The following are equivalent:

  ```Q#
  let c = a <<< b;
  let c = LeftShiftedL(a, b);
  ```
syntax: 'function LeftShiftedL (value : BigInt, amount : Int) : BigInt'
input:
  content: '(value : BigInt, amount : Int)'
  types:
  - name: value
    summary: |-
      The number whose bitwise representation is to be shifted to the left
      (more significant).
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: BigInt
