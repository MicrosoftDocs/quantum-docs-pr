name: RightShiftedL
type: function
namespace: microsoft.quantum.bitwise
summary: |-
  Shifts the bitwise representation of a number right by a given number of
  bits.
remarks: |-
  The following are equivalent:

  ```Q#
  let c = a >>> b;
  let c = RightShiftedL(a, b);
  ```

input:
  content: '(value : BigInt, amount : Int)'
  types:
  - name: value
    summary: |-
      The number whose bitwise representation is to be shifted to the right
      (less significant).
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: BigInt
  - name: amount
    summary: The number of bits by which `value` is to be shifted to the right.
