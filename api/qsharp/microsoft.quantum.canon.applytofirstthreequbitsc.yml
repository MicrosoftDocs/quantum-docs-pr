uid: microsoft.quantum.canon.applytofirstthreequbitsc
name: ApplyToFirstThreeQubitsC
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: |-
  Applies an operation to the first three qubits in the register.
  The modifier `C` indicates that the operation is controllable.
remarks: |-
  This is equivalent to:

  ```qsharp
  op(register[0], register[1], register[2]);
  ```
syntax: 'operation ApplyToFirstThreeQubitsC (op : ((Qubit, Qubit, Qubit) => Unit is Ctl), register : Qubit[]) : Unit'
input:
  content: '(op : ((Qubit, Qubit, Qubit) => Unit is Ctl), register : Qubit[])'
  types:
  - name: op
