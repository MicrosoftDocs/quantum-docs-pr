uid: microsoft.quantum.canon.applytofirstthreequbitsca
name: ApplyToFirstThreeQubitsCA
type: operation
namespace: microsoft.quantum.canon
summary: |-
  Applies an operation to the first three qubits in the register.
  The modifier `CA` indicates that the operation is controllable and adjointable.
remarks: |-
  This is equivalent to:

  ```qsharp
  op(register[0], register[1], register[2]);
  ```
syntax: 'operation ApplyToFirstThreeQubitsCA (op : ((Qubit, Qubit, Qubit) => Unit is Adj + Ctl), register : Qubit[]) : Unit'
input:
  content: '(op : ((Qubit, Qubit, Qubit) => Unit is Adj + Ctl), register : Qubit[])'
  types:
  - name: op
