Given an array of operations acting on a single input,produces a new operation thatperforms each given operation in sequence.The modifier `CA` indicates that all operations in the array are adjointableand controllable.

```qsharp
function BoundCA<'T> (operations : ('T => Unit is Adj + Ctl)[]) : ('T => Unit is Adj + Ctl)
```


## Input

### operations : 'T => [Unit](xref:microsoft.quantum.lang-ref.unit) Adj + Ctl[]

A sequence of operations to be performed on a given input.



## Output : 'T => [Unit](xref:microsoft.quantum.lang-ref.unit) Adj + Ctl

A new operation that performs each given operation in sequenceon its input.

## Type Parameters

### 'T

The target on which each of the operations in the array act.
