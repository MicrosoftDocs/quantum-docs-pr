uid: microsoft.quantum.canon.conjugatedbya
name: ConjugatedByA
type: function
namespace: microsoft.quantum.canon
summary: |-
  Given outer and inner operations, returns a new operation that
  conjugates the inner operation by the outer operation.
remarks: |-
  The outer operation is always assumed to be adjointable, but does not
  need to be controllable in order for the combined operation to be
  controllable.
syntax: "function ConjugatedByA (outerOperation : ('T => Unit is Adj), innerOperation : ('T => Unit is Adj)) : ('T => Unit is Adj)"
input:
  content: "(outerOperation : ('T => Unit is Adj), innerOperation : ('T => Unit is Adj))"
  types:
  - name: outerOperation
    summary: |-
      The operation $U$ that should be used to conjugate $V$. Note that the
      outer operation $U$ needs to be adjointable, but does not
      need to be controllable.
