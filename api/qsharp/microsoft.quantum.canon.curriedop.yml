uid: microsoft.quantum.canon.curriedop
name: CurriedOp
type: function
namespace: microsoft.quantum.canon
summary: |-
  Returns a curried version of an operation on two inputs.

  That is, given an operation with two inputs, this function applies Curry's isomorphism
  $f(x, y) \equiv f(x)(y)$ to return an operation of one input which
  returns an operation of one input.
remarks: |-
  The following are equivalent:

  ```qsharp
  op(x, y);

  let curried = CurriedOp(op);
  let partial = curried(x);
  partial(y);
  ```
syntax: "function CurriedOp (op : (('T, 'U) => Unit)) : ('T -> ('U => Unit))"
input:
  content: "(op : (('T, 'U) => Unit))"
  types:
  - name: op
    summary: An operation whose input is a pair.
