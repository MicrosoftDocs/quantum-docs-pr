name: DelayC
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: |-
  Applies a given operation with a delay.

  Given an operation and an input to that operation, applies
  the operation once an additional input is provided.
  In particular, the expression `Delay(op, arg, _)` is an operation that
  applies `op` to `arg` when called.
  Expression `Delay(op,arg,_)` allows to delay the application of `op`.
