### YamlMime:QSharpType
uid: microsoft.quantum.canon.noop
name: NoOp
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: |-
  Performs the identity operation (no-op) on an argument.

  This operation takes a value of any type and does nothing to it.
  This can be useful whenever an input of an operation type is expected,
  but no action should be taken.
  For instance, if a particular error correction syndrome indicates that
  no error has occurred, `NoOp<Qubit[]>` may be the correct recovery
  procedure.
  Similarly, if an operation expects a state preparation procedure as
  input, `NoOp<Qubit[]>` can be used to prepare the state
  $\ket{0 \cdots 0}$.
remarks: |-
  In almost all cases, the type parameter for `NoOp` needs to be specified
  explicitly. For instance, `NoOp<Qubit>` is identical to
  <xref:microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.i>.
