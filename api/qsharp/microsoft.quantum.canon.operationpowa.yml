name: OperationPowA
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: |-
  Raises an operation to a power.
  The modifier `A` indicates that the operation is adjointable.

  That is, given an operation representing a gate $U$, returns a new operation
  $U^m$ for a power $m$.
syntax: "function OperationPowA (op : ('T => Unit is Adj), power : Int) : ('T => Unit is Adj)"
input:
  content: "(op : ('T => Unit is Adj), power : Int)"
  types:
  - name: op
    summary: An operation $U$ representing the gate to be repeated.
    isOperation: true

    output:
      types:
      - isPrimitive: true
        uid: Unit
    functors:

  - name: power
    summary: The number of times that $U$ is to be repeated.
    isPrimitive: true
