uid: microsoft.quantum.canon.operationpowc
name: OperationPowC
type: function
namespace: microsoft.quantum.canon
summary: |-
  Raises an operation to a power.
  The modifier `C` indicates that the operation is controllable.

  That is, given an operation representing a gate $U$, returns a new operation
  $U^m$ for a power $m$.
syntax: "function OperationPowC (op : ('T => Unit is Ctl), power : Int) : ('T => Unit is Ctl)"
input:
  content: "(op : ('T => Unit is Ctl), power : Int)"
  types:
  - name: op
    summary: An operation $U$ representing the gate to be repeated.
    isOperation: true
