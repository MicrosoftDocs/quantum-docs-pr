name: ContinuousPhaseEstimationIteration
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Characterization
summary: |-
  Performs a single iteration of an iterative (classically-controlled) phase
  estimation algorithm using arbitrary real powers of a unitary oracle.
syntax: 'operation ContinuousPhaseEstimationIteration (oracle : Microsoft.Quantum.Oracles.ContinuousOracle, time : Double, theta : Double, targetState : Qubit[], controlQubit : Qubit) : Unit'
input:
  content: '(oracle : Microsoft.Quantum.Oracles.ContinuousOracle, time : Double, theta : Double, targetState : Qubit[], controlQubit : Qubit)'
  types:
  - name: oracle
    summary: |-
      Operation acting on a double $t$ and a register,
      such that $U^t$ is applied to the given register, where $U$ is the unitary
      whose phase is to be estimated, and where $t$ is the integer power
      given to the oracle
    uid: microsoft.quantum.oracles.continuousoracle
  - name: time
    summary: Number of times to apply the given unitary oracle.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Double

    summary: |-
      Angle by which to invert the phase on the control qubit before
      acting on the target state.
