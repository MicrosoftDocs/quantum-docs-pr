summary: |-
  Given a preparation and measurement, estimates the frequency
  with which that measurement succeeds (returns `Zero`) by
  performing a given number of trials.

      The number of qubits on which the preparation and measurement
      each act.

    summary: |-
      The number of times that the measurement should be performed
      in order to estimate the frequency of interest.

  content: Double

  - summary: |-
      An estimate $\hat{p}$ of the frequency with which
      $M(P(\ket{00 \cdots 0}\bra{00 \cdots 0}))$ returns `Zero`,
      obtained using the unbiased binomial estimator $\hat{p} =
      n\_{\uparrow} / n\_{\text{measurements}}$, where $n\_{\uparrow}$ is
      the number of `Zero` results observed.

      This is particularly important on target machines which respect
      physical limitations, such that probabilities cannot be measured.
