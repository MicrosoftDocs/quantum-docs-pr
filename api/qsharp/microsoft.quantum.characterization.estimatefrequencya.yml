type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Characterization
summary: |-
  Given a preparation that is adjointable and measurement, estimates the frequency
  with which that measurement succeeds (returns `Zero`) by
  performing a given number of trials.
remarks: |-
  For adjointable operations, certain assumptions can be made such like
  calling the operation will prepare the qubits to exactly the same state,
  which allow target machines to make some performance optimizations.

      An estimate $\hat{p}$ of the frequency with which
      $M(P(\ket{00 \cdots 0}\bra{00 \cdots 0}))$ returns `Zero`,
      obtained using the unbiased binomial estimator $\hat{p} =
      n\_{\uparrow} / n\_{\text{measurements}}$, where $n\_{\uparrow}$ is
      the number of `Zero` results observed.
