type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Characterization
summary: |-
  Given two operations which each prepare copies of a state, estimates
  the squared overlap between the states prepared by each
  operation.
remarks: |-
  This operation uses the SWAP test to find
  $$
  \begin{align}
  \left| \braket{00\cdots 0 | V^{\dagger} U | 00\cdots 0} \right|^2
  \end{align}
  $$
  where $U$ is the unitary representation of the action of `preparation1`,
  and where $V$ corresponds to `preparation2`.
