type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Characterization
summary: |-
  Given two operations which each prepare copies of a state, estimates
  the real part of the overlap between the states prepared by each
  operation.
remarks: |-
  This operation uses the Hadamard test to find the real part of
  $$
  \begin{align}
  \braket{\psi | V^{\dagger} U | \psi}
  \end{align}
  $$
  where $\ket{\psi}$ is the state prepared by `commonPreparation`,
  $U$ is the unitary representation of the action of `preparation1`,
  and where $V$ corresponds to `preparation2`.
syntax: 'operation EstimateRealOverlapBetweenStates (commonPreparation : (Qubit[] => Unit is Adj), preparation1 : (Qubit[] => Unit is Adj + Ctl), preparation2 : (Qubit[] => Unit is Adj + Ctl), nQubits : Int, nMeasurements : Int) : Double'
