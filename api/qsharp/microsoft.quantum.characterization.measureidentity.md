# MeasureIdentity operation

Namespace: [Microsoft.Quantum.Characterization](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Characterization)

Package: [](https://nuget.org/packages/)


Measures the identity operator on a registerof qubits.

```qsharp
operation MeasureIdentity (register : Qubit[]) : Result
```


## Input

### register : [Qubit](xref:microsoft.quantum.lang-ref.qubit)[]

The register to be measured.



## Output : __invalid<Result>__

The result value `Zero`.

## Remarks

Since $\boldone$ has only the eigenvalue $1$, and does nothave a negative eigenvalue, this operation always returns`Zero`, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+1 = (-1)^0$,and does not cause a collapse of the state of `register`.On its own, this operation is not useful, but is helpfulin the context of process tomography, as it providesinformation about the trace preservation of a quantum process.In particular, a target machine with lossy measurement shouldreplace this operation by an actual measurement of $\boldone$.
