name: MeasureIdentity
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Characterization
summary: |-
  Measures the identity operator on a register
  of qubits.
remarks: |-
  Since $\boldone$ has only the eigenvalue $1$, and does not
  have a negative eigenvalue, this operation always returns
  `Zero`, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+1 = (-1)^0$,
  and does not cause a collapse of the state of `register`.

  On its own, this operation is not useful, but is helpful
  in the context of process tomography, as it provides
  information about the trace preservation of a quantum process.
  In particular, a target machine with lossy measurement should
  replace this operation by an actual measurement of $\boldone$.
