name: RangeStart
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Core
summary: Returns the defined start value of the given range.
remarks: |-
  A range expression's first element is `start`,
  its second element is `start+step`, third element is `start+step+step`, etc.,
  until `end` is passed.

  Note that the defined start value of a range is the same as the first element of the sequence,
  unless the range specifies an empty sequence (for example, 2 .. 1).
