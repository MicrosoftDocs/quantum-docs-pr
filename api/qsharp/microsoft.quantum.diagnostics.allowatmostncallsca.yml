name: AllowAtMostNCallsCA
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics
summary: |-
  Between a call to this operation and its adjoint, asserts that
  a given operation is called at most a certain number of times.
remarks: |-
  This operation may be replaced by a no-op on targets which do not
  support it.
examples: |-
  The following snippet will fail when executed on machines which
  support this diagnostic:

  ```Q#
  using (register = Qubit[4]) {
      within {
          AllowAtMostNCallsCA(3, H, "Too many calls to H.");
      } apply {
          // Fails since this calls H four times, rather than the
          // allowed maximum of three.
          ApplyToEach(H, register);
      }
  }
  ```
