name: AllowAtMostNQubits
type: operation
namespace: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics
summary: |-
  Between a call to this operation and its adjoint, asserts that
  at most a given number of additional qubits are allocated with
  using statements.
remarks: |-
  This operation may be replaced by a no-op on targets which do not
  support it.
examples: |-
  The following snippet will fail when executed on machines which
  support this diagnostic:

  ```Q#
  within {
      AllowAtMostNQubits(3, "Too many qubits allocated.");
  } apply {
      // Fails since this allocates four qubits.
      using (register = Qubit[4]) {
      }
  }
  ```
syntax: 'operation AllowAtMostNQubits (nQubits : Int, message : String) : Unit'
input:
  content: '(nQubits : Int, message : String)'
