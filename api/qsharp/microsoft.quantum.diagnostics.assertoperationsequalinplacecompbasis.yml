type: operation
namespace: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics
summary: |-
  Checks if the operation `givenU` is equal to the operation `expectedU` on
  the given input size  by checking the action of the operations only on
  the vectors from the computational basis.
  This is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the equality of
  two unitaries.
syntax: 'operation AssertOperationsEqualInPlaceCompBasis (nQubits : Int, givenU : (Qubit[] => Unit), expectedU : (Qubit[] => Unit is Adj)) : Unit'
input:
  content: '(nQubits : Int, givenU : (Qubit[] => Unit), expectedU : (Qubit[] => Unit is Adj))'
  types:
  - name: nQubits
    summary: The number of qubits $n$ that the operations `givenU` and `expectedU` operate on.
