name: AssertQubit
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics
summary: Asserts that the qubit `q` is in the expected eigenstate of the Pauli Z operator.
remarks: |-
  <xref:microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.assertqubitisinstatewithintolerance> allows for asserting
  arbitrary qubit states rather than only $Z$ eigenstates.
