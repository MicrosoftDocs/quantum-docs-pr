# DumpMachine function

Namespace: [Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics)

Package: [](https://nuget.org/packages/)


Dumps the current target machine's status.

```qsharp
function DumpMachine<'T> (location : 'T) : Unit
```


## Input

### location : 'T

Provides information on where to generate the machine's dump.



## Output : [Unit](xref:microsoft.quantum.lang-ref.unit)

None.

## Type Parameters

### 'T



## Remarks

This method allows you to dump information about the current status of thetarget machine into a file or some other location.The actual information generated and the semantics of `location`are specific to each target machine. However, providing an empty tuple as a location (`()`)or just omitting the `location` parameter typically means to generate the output to the console.For the local full state simulator distributed as part of theQuantum Development Kit, this method  expects a string withthe path to a file in which it will write the wave function as aone-dimensional array of complex numbers, in which each element representsthe amplitudes of the probability of measuring the corresponding state.
