# DumpOperation operation

Namespace: [Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics)

Package: [](https://nuget.org/packages/)


Given an operation, displays diagnostics aboutthe operation that are made available by the currentexecution target.

```qsharp
operation DumpOperation (nQubits : Int, op : (Qubit[] => Unit is Adj)) : Unit
```


## Input

### nQubits : [Int](xref:microsoft.quantum.lang-ref.int)

The number of qubits on which the given operation acts.


### op : [Qubit](xref:microsoft.quantum.lang-ref.qubit)[] => [Unit](xref:microsoft.quantum.lang-ref.unit) Adj

The operation that is to be diagnosed.



## Output : [Unit](xref:microsoft.quantum.lang-ref.unit)



## Remarks

Calling this operation has no observable effect from withinQ#. The exact diagnostics that are displayed, if any, aredependent on the current execution target and editor environment.For example, when used on the full-state quantum simulator,a unitary matrix used to represent `op` is displayed.Note that, when run on simulators that admit a global phase ambiguity(e.g.: the full-state simulator), returned representations may varyup to a global phase.Similarly, the ordering of rows and columns matrix representationsmay vary with the conventions used by each simulator supporting thisoperation.
