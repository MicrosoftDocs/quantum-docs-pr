uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.dumpoperation
name: DumpOperation
type: operation
namespace: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics
summary: |-
  Given an operation, displays diagnostics about
  the operation that are made available by the current
  execution target.
remarks: |-
  Calling this operation has no observable effect from within
  Q#. The exact diagnostics that are displayed, if any, are
  dependent on the current execution target and editor environment.
  For example, when used on the full-state quantum simulator,
  a unitary matrix used to represent `op` is displayed.

  Note that, when run on simulators that admit a global phase ambiguity
  (e.g.: the full-state simulator), returned representations may vary
  up to a global phase.

  Similarly, the ordering of rows and columns matrix representations
  may vary with the conventions used by each simulator supporting this
  operation.
examples: |-
  When run on the quantum simulator target, the following snippet
  will output the matrix
  $\left(\begin{matrix} 0.0 & 0.707 \\\\ 0.707 & 0.0\end{matrix}\right)$:

  ```Q#
  open Microsoft.Quantum.Arrays as Arrays;

  operation ApplyH(register : Qubit[]) : Unit is Adj + Ctl {
      H(Head(register));
  }

  operation DumpH() : Unit {
      DumpOperation(1, ApplyH);
  }
  ```

  When run on the quantum simulator target, the following snippet will
  output the matrix
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  \left(\begin{matrix}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0
  \end{matrix}\right)
  \end{aligned}.
  $$

  ```Q#
  operation DumpCnot() : Unit {
      DumpOperation(2, ApplyToFirstTwoQubitsCA(CNOT, _));
  }
  ```
