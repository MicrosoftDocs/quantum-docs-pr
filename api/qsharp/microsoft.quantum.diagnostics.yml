    \ entangled registers. Thus, this operation needs only a single call to each operation\
    \ being tested, but requires twice as many qubits to be allocated. This assertion\
    \ can be used to ensure, for instance, that an optimized version of an operation\
    \ acts identically to its na\xEFve implementation, or that an operation which\
