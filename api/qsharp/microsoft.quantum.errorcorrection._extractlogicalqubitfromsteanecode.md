Syndrome measurement and the inverse of embedding.$X$- and $Z$-stabilizers are not treated equally,which is due to the particular choice of the encoding circuit.This asymmetry leads to a different syndrome extraction routine.One could measure the syndrome by measuring multi-qubit Pauli operatordirectly on the code state, but for the distillation purposethe logical qubit is returned into a single qubit,in course of which the syndrome measurements can be done without further ancillas.

```qsharp
operation _ExtractLogicalQubitFromSteaneCode (code : Microsoft.Quantum.ErrorCorrection.LogicalRegister) : (Qubit, Int, Int)
```


## Input

### code : [LogicalRegister](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.ErrorCorrection.LogicalRegister)





## Output : ([Qubit](xref:microsoft.quantum.lang-ref.qubit),[Int](xref:microsoft.quantum.lang-ref.int),[Int](xref:microsoft.quantum.lang-ref.int))

The logical qubit and a pair of integers for $X$-syndrome and $Z$-syndrome.They represent the index of the code qubit on which a single $X$- or $Z$-errorwould have caused the measured syndrome.

## Remarks

Note that this operation is not marked as `internal`, as unit testsdirectly depend on this operation. As a future improvement, unit testsshould be refactored to depend only on public callables directly.> [!WARNING]> This routine is tailored> to a particular encoding circuit for Steane's 7 qubit code;> if the encoding circuit is modified then the syndrome outcome> might have to be interpreted differently.
