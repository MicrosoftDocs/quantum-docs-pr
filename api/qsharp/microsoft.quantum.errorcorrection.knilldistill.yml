summary: |-
  Implements the Knill magic state distillation algorithm.

  Given 15 approximate copies of a magic state
  $$
  \begin{align}
  \cos\frac{\pi}{8} \ket{0} + \sin \frac{\pi}{8} \ket{1}
  \end{align},
  $$
  yields one higher-quality copy.
remarks: |-
  We follow the algorithm of Knill.
  However, the present implementation is far from being optimal,
  as it uses too many qubits.
  The magic states are injected in this routine,
  in which case there are better protocols.

    summary: |-
      A register of fifteen qubits containing approximate copies
      of a magic state. Following application of this distillation
      procedure, `roughMagic[0]` will contain one higher-quality
      copy, and the rest of the register will be reset to the
      $\ket{00\cdots 0}$ state.

  - summary: |-
      If `true`, then the procedure succeeded and the higher-quality
      copy should be accepted. If `false`, the procedure failed, and
      the state of the register should be considered undefined.
