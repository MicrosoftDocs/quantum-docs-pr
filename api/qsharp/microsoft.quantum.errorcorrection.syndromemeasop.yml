uid: microsoft.quantum.errorcorrection.syndromemeasop
name: SyndromeMeasOp
type: newtype
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.ErrorCorrection
summary: |-
  Represents an operation that is used to measure the syndrome
  of an error-correcting code block.
remarks: |-
  The signature `(LogicalRegister => Syndrome)` represents an operation
  that acts jointly on the qubits in `LogicalRegister` and some auxillary
  qubits followed by a measurements of the auxillary qubits to extract a
  `Syndrome` value representing the `Result[]` of these measurements.

  ### Examples
  Measure syndromes for the bit-flip code
  $S = \langle ZZI, IZZ \rangle$ using scratch qubits in a
  non–fault tolerant manner:

  ```qsharp
      let syndMeasOp = SyndromeMeasOp(MeasureStabilizerGenerators([
              [PauliZ, PauliZ, PauliI],
              [PauliI, PauliZ, PauliZ]
          ], _, MeasureWithScratch));
  ```
syntax: newtype SyndromeMeasOp = (Microsoft.Quantum.ErrorCorrection.LogicalRegister => Microsoft.Quantum.ErrorCorrection.Syndrome);
