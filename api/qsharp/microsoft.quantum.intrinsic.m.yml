uid: microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.m
name: M
type: operation
namespace: microsoft.quantum.intrinsic
summary: |-
  Performs a measurement of a single qubit in the
  Pauli $Z$ basis.

  The output result is given by
  the distribution
  \begin{align}
  \Pr(\texttt{Zero} | \ket{\psi}) =
  \braket{\psi | 0} \braket{0 | \psi}.
  \end{align}
remarks: |-
  Equivalent to:

  ```qsharp
  Measure([PauliZ], [qubit]);
  ```
syntax: 'operation M (qubit : Qubit) : Result'
input:
  content: '(qubit : Qubit)'
  types:
  - name: qubit
    summary: Qubit to be measured.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Qubit
output:
  content: Result
  types:
  - summary: |-
      `Zero` if the $+1$ eigenvalue is observed, and `One` if
      the $-1$ eigenvalue is observed.
