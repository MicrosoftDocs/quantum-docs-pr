type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic
summary: |-
  Applies a rotation about the given Pauli axis.

  \begin{align}
  R_{\mu}(\theta) \mathrel{:=}
  e^{-i \theta \sigma_{\mu} / 2},
  \end{align}
  where $\mu \in \{I, X, Y, Z\}$.
remarks: |-
  When called with `pauli = PauliI`, this operation applies
  a *global phase*. This phase can be significant
  when used with the `Controlled` functor.
