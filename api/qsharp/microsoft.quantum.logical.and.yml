uid: microsoft.quantum.logical.and
name: And
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Logical
summary: Returns the Boolean conjunction of two values.
remarks: |-
  Unlike the `and` operator, this function does not short-circuit, such that
  both inputs are fully evaluated.

  Up to short-circuiting behavior, the following are equivalent:

  ```Q#
  let x = a and b;
  let x = And(a, b);
  ```
syntax: 'function And (a : Bool, b : Bool) : Bool'
input:
  content: '(a : Bool, b : Bool)'
  types:
  - name: a
    summary: The first value to be considered.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Bool
  - name: b
    summary: The second value to be considered.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Bool
output:
  content: Bool
  types:
  - summary: '`true` if and only if `a` and `b` are both `true`.'
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Bool
