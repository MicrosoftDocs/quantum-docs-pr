uid: microsoft.quantum.logical.conditioned
name: Conditioned
type: function
namespace: microsoft.quantum.logical
summary: Returns one of two values, depending on the value of a Boolean condition.
remarks: |-
  Unlike the `?|` operator, this function does not short-circuit, such that
  both inputs are fully evaluated.

  Up to short-circuiting behavior, the following are equivalent:

  ```Q#
  let x = condition ? ifTrue | ifFalse;
  let x = Conditioned(condition, ifTrue, ifFalse);
  ```
syntax: "function Conditioned (condition : Bool, ifTrue : 'T, ifFalse : 'T) : 'T"
input:
  content: "(condition : Bool, ifTrue : 'T, ifFalse : 'T)"
  types:
  - name: condition
    summary: A condition used to control which input is returned.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Bool
  - name: ifTrue
    summary: The value to be returned when `condition` is `true`.
    uid: "'T"
    isLocal: true
  - name: ifFalse
    summary: The value to be returned when `condition` is `false`.
    uid: "'T"
    isLocal: true
output:
  content: "'T"
  types:
  - summary: '`ifTrue` if `condition` is `true`, and `ifFalse` otherwise.'
    uid: "'T"
    isLocal: true
