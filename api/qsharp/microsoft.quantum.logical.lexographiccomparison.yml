uid: microsoft.quantum.logical.lexographiccomparison
name: LexographicComparison
type: function
namespace: microsoft.quantum.logical
summary: |-
  Given a comparison function, returns a new function that
  lexographically compares two arrays.
remarks: |-
  The lexographic comparison between two arrays `xs` and `ys` is defined
  by the following procedure. We say that two elements `x` and `y`
  are equivalent if `elementComparison(x, y)` and `elementComparison(y, x)`
  are both true.

  - Both arrays are compared element-by-element until the first pair of
    elements that are not equivalent. The array containing the element
    that occurs first according to `elementComparison` is said to occur
    first in lexographical ordering.
  - If no inequivalent elements are found, and one array is longer than
    the other, the shorter array is said to occur first.
