name: ControlledRotation
type: newtype
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.MachineLearning
summary: |-
  Describes a controlled rotation in terms of its target and control
  indices, rotation axis, and index into a model parameter vector.
remarks: |-
  An uncontrolled rotation can be represented by setting `ControlIndices`
  to an empty array of indexes, `new Int[0]`.

  ### Examples
  The following represents a rotation about the $X$-axis of the first
  qubit in a register, controlled on the second qubit, and with an
  angle given by the fourth parameter in a sequential model:

  ```Q#
  let controlledRotation = ControlledRotation(
      (0, [1]),
      PauliX,
      3
  )
  ```
syntax: newtype ControlledRotation = ((Int, Int[]), Pauli, Int);
