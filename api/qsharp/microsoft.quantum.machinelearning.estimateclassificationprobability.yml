summary: |-
  Given a sample and a sequential classifier, estimates the
  classification probability for that sample by repeatedly measuring
  the output of the classifier on the given sample.
syntax: 'operation EstimateClassificationProbability (tolerance : Double, model : Microsoft.Quantum.MachineLearning.SequentialModel, sample : Double[], nMeasurements : Int) : Double'
