uid: microsoft.quantum.math.modulusl
name: ModulusL
type: function
namespace: microsoft.quantum.math
summary: Computes the canonical residue of `value` modulo `modulus`.
remarks: |-
  This function behaves different to how the operator `%` behaves in C# and Q# as in the result
  is always a positive integer between 0 and `modulus - 1`, even if value is negative.
syntax: 'function ModulusL (value : BigInt, modulus : BigInt) : BigInt'
