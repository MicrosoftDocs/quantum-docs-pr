uid: microsoft.quantum.math.randomint
name: RandomInt
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Math
summary: |-
  Generates a uniformly sampled random integer greater than or equal to zero
  and less than a provided upper bound.
remarks: |-
  This function calls <xref:microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.random>, so
  its randomness depends on the implementation of `Random`.
