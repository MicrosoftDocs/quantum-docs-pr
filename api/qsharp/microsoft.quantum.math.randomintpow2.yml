uid: microsoft.quantum.math.randomintpow2
name: RandomIntPow2
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Math
summary: |-
  Generates a random integer uniformly sampled from all integers that can be represented
  in a given number of bits.
remarks: |-
  This function calls <xref:microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.random>, so
  its randomness depends on the implementation of `Random`.
syntax: 'operation RandomIntPow2 (maxBits : Int) : Int'
input:
  content: '(maxBits : Int)'
  types:
  - name: maxBits
    summary: |-
      The number of classical bits required to represent the largest integer
      that could be returned by this operation.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Int
output:
  content: Int
  types:
  - summary: |-
      An integer $x$ uniformly at random from $[0,2^{\texttt{maxBits}}-1]$;
      that is, with $\Pr(x) = \frac{1}{2^{\texttt{maxBits}}}$.
