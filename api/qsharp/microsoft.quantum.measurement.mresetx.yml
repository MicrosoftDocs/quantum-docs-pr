name: MResetX
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Measurement
summary: |-
  Measures a single qubit in the X basis,
  and resets it to a fixed initial state
  following the measurement.

  Performs a single-qubit measurement in the $X$-basis,
  and ensures that the qubit is returned to $\ket{0}$
  following the measurement.
