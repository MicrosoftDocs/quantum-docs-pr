uid: microsoft.quantum.measurement.mresetz
name: MResetZ
type: operation
namespace: microsoft.quantum.measurement
summary: |-
  Measures a single qubit in the Z basis,
  and resets it to a fixed initial state
  following the measurement.

  Performs a single-qubit measurement in the $Z$-basis,
  and ensures that the qubit is returned to $\ket{0}$
  following the measurement.
