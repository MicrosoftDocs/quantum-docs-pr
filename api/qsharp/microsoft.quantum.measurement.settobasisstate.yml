uid: microsoft.quantum.measurement.settobasisstate
name: SetToBasisState
type: operation
namespace: microsoft.quantum.measurement
summary: |-
  Sets a qubit to a given computational basis state by measuring the
  qubit and applying a bit flip if needed.
remarks: |-
  As an invariant of this operation, calling `M(q)` immediately
  after `SetToBasisState(result, q)` will return `result`.
syntax: 'operation SetToBasisState (desired : Result, target : Qubit) : Unit'
input:
  content: '(desired : Result, target : Qubit)'
  types:
  - name: desired
    summary: The basis state that the qubit should be set to.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Result
  - name: target
    summary: The qubit whose state is to be set.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Qubit
output:
  content: Unit
