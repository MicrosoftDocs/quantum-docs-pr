name: LocalUnivariateMinimum
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Optimization
summary: |-
  Returns the local minimum for a univariate function over a bounded interval,
  using a golden interval search.
syntax: 'function LocalUnivariateMinimum (fn : (Double -> Double), bounds : (Double, Double), tolerance : Double) : Microsoft.Quantum.Optimization.UnivariateOptimizationResult'
input:
  content: '(fn : (Double -> Double), bounds : (Double, Double), tolerance : Double)'

    summary: |-
      The accuracy in the function input to be tolerated.
      The search for local optima will continue until the interval is
      smaller in width than this tolerance.
