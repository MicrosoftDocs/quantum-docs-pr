uid: microsoft.quantum.preparation.preparequbit
name: PrepareQubit
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Preparation
summary: |-
  Prepares a qubit in the +1 (`Zero`) eigenstate of the given Pauli operator.
  If the identity operator is given, then the qubit is prepared in the maximally
  mixed state.

  If the qubit was initially in the $\ket{0}$ state, this operation prepares the
  qubit in the $+1$ eigenstate of a given Pauli operator, or, for `PauliI`,
  in the maximally mixed state instead (see <xref:microsoft.quantum.preparation.preparesinglequbitidentity>).

  If the qubit was in a state other than $\ket{0}$, this operation applies the following gates:
  $H$ for `PauliX`, $HS$ for `PauliY`, $I$ for `PauliZ` and
  <xref:microsoft.quantum.preparation.preparesinglequbitidentity> for `PauliI`.
