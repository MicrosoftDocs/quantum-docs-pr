uid: microsoft.quantum.preparation.preparesinglequbitidentity
name: PrepareSingleQubitIdentity
type: operation
namespace: microsoft.quantum.preparation
summary: |-
  Prepares a qubit in the maximally mixed state.

  It prepares the given qubit in the $\boldone / 2$ state by applying the depolarizing channel
  $$
  \begin{align}
  \Omega(\rho) \mathrel{:=} \frac{1}{4} \sum_{\mu \in \{0, 1, 2, 3\}} \sigma\_{\mu} \rho \sigma\_{\mu}^{\dagger},
  \end{align}
  $$
  where $\sigma\_i$ is the $i$th Pauli operator, and where
  $\rho$ is a density operator representing a mixed state.
remarks: |-
  The mixed state $\boldone / 2$ describing the result of
  applying this operation to a state implicitly describes
  an expectation value over random choices made in this operation.
  Thus, for any single application, this operation maps pure states
  to pure states, but it acts as described in expectation.
  In particular, this operation can be used in process tomography
  to measure the *non-unital* components of a channel.
