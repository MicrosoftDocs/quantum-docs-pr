uid: microsoft.quantum.random.drawcategorical
name: DrawCategorical
type: operation
namespace: microsoft.quantum.random
summary: |-
  Draws a random sample from a categorical distribution specified by a
  list of probablities.

  The probability of selecting a specific index is proportional to the value
  of the array element at that index.
  Array elements that are equal to zero are ignored and their indices are never
  returned. If any array element is less than zero,
  or if no array element is greater than zero, then the operation fails.

    summary: |-
      An array of floating-point numbers proportional to the probability of
      selecting each index.

      An integer $i$ with probability $\Pr(i) = p_i / \sum_i p_i$, where $p_i$
      is the $i$th element of `probs`.
