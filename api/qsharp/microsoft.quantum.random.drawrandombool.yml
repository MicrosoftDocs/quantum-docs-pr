name: DrawRandomBool
type: operation
namespace: microsoft.quantum.random
summary: |-
  Given a success probability, returns a single Bernoulli trial that
  is true with the given probability.
examples: |-
  The following Q# snippet samples flips from a biased coin:

  ```Q#
  let flips = DrawMany(DrawRandomBool, 10, 0.6);
  ```
syntax: 'operation DrawRandomBool (successProbability : Double) : Bool'

    summary: The probability with which `true` should be returned.
    isPrimitive: true
    uid: Double
output:
  content: Bool
  types:
  - summary: |-
      `true` with probability `successProbability` and `false` with
      probability `1.0 - successProbability`.
