name: DrawRandomBool
type: operation
namespace: microsoft.quantum.random
summary: |-
  Given a success probability, returns a single Bernoulli trial that
  is true with the given probability.
examples: |-
  The following Q# snippet samples flips from a biased coin:

  ```Q#
  let flips = DrawMany(DrawRandomBool, 10, 0.6);
  ```
