  Represents a unitary where an arbitrary operator of
  interest is encoded in the top-left block.

  That is, a `BlockEncoding` is a unitary $U$ where an arbitrary operator $H$ of
  interest that acts on the system register `s` is encoded in the top-
  left block corresponding to auxiliary state $\ket{0}_a$. That is,

  $$
  \begin{align}
  (\bra{0}_a\otimes I_s)U(\ket{0}_a\otimes I_s) = H
  \end{align}
