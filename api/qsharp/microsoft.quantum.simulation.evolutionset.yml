type: newtype
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Simulation
summary: |-
  Represents a set of gates that can be readily implemented and used
  to implement simulation algorithms.

  Elements in the set are indexed
  by a  <xref:microsoft.quantum.simulation.generatorindex>,
  and each set is described by a function
  from `GeneratorIndex` to  <xref:microsoft.quantum.simulation.evolutionunitary>,
  which are operations
  parameterized by a real number representing time
syntax: newtype EvolutionSet = (Microsoft.Quantum.Simulation.GeneratorIndex -> Microsoft.Quantum.Simulation.EvolutionUnitary);
