summary: |-
  Represents a `BlockEncoding` that is controlled by a clock register.

  That is, a `TimeDependentBlockEncoding` is a unitary $U$ controlled by a state
  $\ket{k}_d$ in clock register `d` such that an arbitrary operator $H_k$ of
  interest that acts on the system register `s` is encoded in the top-
  left block corresponding to auxiliary state $\ket{0}_a$. That is,

  $$
  \begin{align}
  (\bra{0}\_a\otimes I_{ds})U(\ket{0}\_a\otimes I_{ds}) = \sum_{k}\ket{k}\bra{k}\_d\otimes H_k.
  \end{align}
  $$.
syntax: newtype TimeDependentBlockEncoding = ((Qubit[], Qubit[], Qubit[]) => Unit is Adj + Ctl);
