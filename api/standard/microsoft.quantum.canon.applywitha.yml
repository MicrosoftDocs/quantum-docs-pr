type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: |-
  Given two operations, applies one as conjugated with the other.

  Given two operations, respectively described by unitary operators $U$
  and $V$, applies them in the sequence $U^{\dagger} V U$. That is,
  this operation implements the unitary operator given by $V$ conjugated
  with $U$.
remarks: |-
  The outer operation is always assumed to be adjointable, but does not
  need to be controllable in order for the combined operation to be
  controllable.
syntax: "operation ApplyWithA (outerOperation : ('T => Unit : Adjoint), innerOperation : ('T => Unit : Adjoint), target : 'T) : Unit"

    summary: |-
      The operation $U$ that should be used to conjugate $V$. Note that the
      outer operation $U$ needs to be adjointable, but does not
      need to be controllable.
