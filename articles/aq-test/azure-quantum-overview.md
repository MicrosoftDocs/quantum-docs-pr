# Introduction to Azure Quantum

Azure Quantum allows you to run Quantum Programs and solve Quantum-Inspired
Optimization (QIO) problems in the cloud. Azure Quantum takes these jobs and
schedules them with the desired provider for execution. Using our SDKs and tools
you can easily run a job against multiple providers and targets to find the one
that will work best for your scenario.

> Note that the current private preview only provides access to quantum-inspired
> optimization. Please contact your business development manager if you are
> interested in trying out other Azure Quantum features in the future.

## Quantum Workspace

Azure Quantum is a service provided by Azure. Like other Azure services, you
need to deploy an Azure Quantum resource into your Azure subscription in order
to use the service. This resource is called an **Azure Quantum Workspace** - or
**Workspace** for short. Please see [Creating an Azure Quantum
Workspace](xref:microsoft.azure.quantum.workspaces-portal) for detailed
instructions.

Once you create a Workspace, you'll be able to select which third party
providers you would like to be able to use in that Workspace. Every Workspace
also comes with the Microsoft provider always enabled. For more information
about providers, see [Providers and Targets](#providers-and-targets) below. If
you haven't enabled a particular provider for execution in your Workspace, you
will not be able to run jobs against that provider later. You may change the
enabled providers in your Workspace after creating it.
> In the current private preview, only the first party Microsoft provider is
> available.

When you enable a provider in your Workspace you also select the billing plan
for that provider, which defines how you're billed for jobs against that
provider. Each provider may have different billing plans and methods available.
For more information, see the documentation on the provider you would like to
enable.

While you may only select a single billing plan for a specific provider in a
single Workspace, you may deploy multiple Workspaces in your Azure subscription.

## Jobs in Azure Quantum

Whenever you execute a Quantum Program or solve a QIO problem in Azure Quantum,
you are creating and running a job. The way to create and run a job depends on
the type of the job and the target (see below for a list of [providers and
targets](#providers-and-targets)), however all jobs have the following
properties:

- **ID**: A unique identifier for a job. Unique within your Workspace.
- **Provider**: _who_ you want to execute your job - e.g. Microsoft or a 3rd
  party
- **Target**: _what_ you want to execute your job on - e.g. the exact quantum
  hardware or solver offered by the provider
- **Name**: a name, chosen by you, to help you organize your jobs
- **Parameters**: some targets take input parameters. See your chosen target for
  a definition of available parameters.

Once created, you'll also find various metadata available about the state of
your job and its execution history.

### Job Lifecycle

Jobs are typically created using one of our SDKs (e.g. the [Python
SDK](xref:microsoft.azure.quantum.qio.python-sdk)) or the QDK. Once you've written
your Quantum Program or expressed your QIO problem, you may pick a target and
run the job.

Once a job has been submitted you must poll for the status of the job. Jobs have
the following possible states:

- `waiting` - the job is waiting to be executed. Some jobs will perform
  pre-processing in the waiting state. `waiting` is always the first state,
  however a job may move to `executing` before you observe it in `waiting`.
- `executing` - the job is currently being executed by the target.
- `succeeded` - _[Final]_ the job has succeeded and output is available.
- `failed` - _[Final]_ the job has failed and error information is available.
- `cancelled` - _[Final]_ the user requested the job execution be cancelled -
  see [Job Cancellation](#job-cancellation).

The diagram below shows the possible state transitions.

![Job submission diagram](../media/aq-diagram.png)

The `succeeded`, `failed`, and `cancelled` states are considered **final
states** - once in one of these states, no more updates will occur. It also
means that the corresponding job output data will not change.

After a job completes successfully, it will have a link to your Azure Storage
account where you can find the output data. How you access this data depends on
the SDK or tool you used to submit the job.

### Job Cancellation

When a job is not in a final state, you may _request_ for the job to be
cancelled. Not all providers support job cancellation in all states. All
providers will cancel your job if it is in the `waiting` state, however if your
job is `executing` the provider may not support cancellation.

If you cancel a job after it has started executing you may still be billed a
partial or full amount for that job. Please see the billing documentation for
your selected provider.

## Providers and Targets

In Azure Quantum, the ability to execute a job is given by **Providers**. A
single Provider may expose one or more **Targets** for execution. A Target is
what is ultimately executing your job.

### Available Providers and Targets

To see a list of available providers, see [Providers](/Reference/Providers).

## Getting Started

When you're ready to get started, please see our guide for [Creating an Azure
Quantum Workspace](xref:microsoft.azure.quantum.workspaces-portal).
