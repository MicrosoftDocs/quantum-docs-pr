# Azure Quantum Release Notes

This article contains information on each Quantum Development Kit release affecting Azure Quantum.

For installation instructions, please refer to the [install guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.install).

For update instructions, please refer to the [update guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.update).

*Release date: July 1st, 2020*

This release contains the following:

- IQ# support for Azure Quantum to submit jobs from Q# Jupyter Notebooks & Python with Q#
- Support for initial design-time diagnostics to determine whether a program can execute on the set target
- New support for executing a targeted Q# application on quantum simulators & resource estimator
- New `qdk-chem` tool for converting legacy electronic structure problem serialization formats (e.g.: FCIDUMP) to Broombridge.
- New functions and operations in the [`Microsoft.Quantum.Synthesis` namespace](xref:microsoft.quantum.synthesis) for coherently applying classical oracles using transformation- and decomposition-based synthesis algorithms.
- IQ# now allows arguments to the `%simulate`, `%estimate`, and other magic commands. See the [`%simulate` magic command reference](xref:microsoft.quantum.iqsharp.magic-ref.simulate) for more details.
- New phase display options in IQ#. See the [`%config` magic command reference](xref:microsoft.quantum.iqsharp.magic-ref.config) for more details.
- IQ# is now provided as a [`conda` package](https://anaconda.org/quantum-engineering/iqsharp) for IQ# installation to support local installation to a conda environment.
- When using the simulator, qubits no longer need to be in the |0‚ü© state upon release, but can be automatically reset if they were measured immediately before releasing.
- Updates to make it easier for IQ# users to consume library packages with different QDK versions, requiring only major & minor version numbers match rather than the exact same version
- Bug fixes
