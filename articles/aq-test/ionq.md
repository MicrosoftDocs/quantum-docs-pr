# IonQ provider

IonQ is a quantum computing hardware and software company. They are developing a
general-purpose trapped ion quantum computer and they are a provider of the
Azure Quantum ecosystem.

- Publisher: [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com)
- Provider ID: `ionq`

## Targets

The following targets are available from this provider:

- [QPU: Trapped ion quantum device](#ionq-trapped-ion-quantum-device)
- [Simulator: IonQ quantum simulator](#ionq-quantum-simulator)

### IonQ Trapped Ion Quantum Device

IonQâ€™s QPU trapped ion quantum computers perform calculations by manipulating
charged atoms held in a vacuum with lasers. This target operates in a **No
control flow** profile, meaning that it can't use results from qubit
measurements to control the execution flow.

- Target ID: `ionq.qpu`

Billing information: **Free in Private Preview**

Monthly quota: **50 hours per month**

### IonQ Quantum Simulator

GPU-accelerated idealized simulator using the same gates IonQ provides on its
quantum devices.

- Job type: `Q# Quantum Application`
- Data Format: ``
- Target ID: `ionq.simulator`

Billing information: **Free in Private Preview**

Monthly quota: **50 hours per month**
