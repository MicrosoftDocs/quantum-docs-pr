# Submit jobs to Azure Quantum with Q# Jupyter Notebooks

This document provides a basic guide to submit and run Q# applications in Azure
Quantum using Q# Jupyter Notebooks.

## Prerequisites 

- You need to have an Azure Quantum workspace in your subscription. To create
  one, follow the guide [Create an Azure Quantum
  workspace](xref:microsoft.azure.quantum.workspaces-portal).

## Installation

Follow these steps to install Jupyter Notebook and the current version of the
IQ# kernel, which powers the Q# Jupyter Notebook and Python experiences.

1. Install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or
   [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads).
1. Open an Anaconda Prompt.
   - Or, if you prefer to use PowerShell or pwsh: open a shell, run `conda init
     powershell`, then close and re-open the shell.
1. Create and activate a new conda environment named `qsharp-env` with the
   required packages (including Jupyter Notebook and IQ#) by running the
   following commands:

    ```bash
    conda create -n qsharp-env -c quantum-engineering qsharp notebook

    conda activate qsharp-env
    ```

1. Run `python -c "import qsharp"` from the same terminal to verify your
   installation and populate your local package cache with all required QDK
   components.

Now you're set up to use Q# Jupyter Notebooks and Q# integration to execute
quantum programs on Azure Quantum.

**NOTE:** You'll want to have the resource ID of your Azure Quantum workspace
handy, as you'll need it for the steps below. You can copy/paste this from the
top-right corner of your Quantum Workspace page in Azure Portal.

## Quantum Execution with Q# Jupyter Notebooks

1. Run `jupyter notebook` from the terminal where your conda environment is
   activated. This starts the notebook server and opens Jupyter in a browser.
1. Create your Q# notebook (via **New** â†’ **Q#**) and write your Q# program.
1. If you've never used Q# with Jupyter, read this first: [Create your first Q#
    notebook](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.jupyter).
1. Write your Q# operations directly in the notebook. Executing the cells will
   compile the Q# code and report whether there are any errors.
    - For example, you could write a Q# operation that looks like this:

        ```qsharp
        operation GenerateRandomBit() : Result {
            using (q = Qubit())  {
                H(q);
                let r = M(q);
                Reset(q);
                return r;
            }
        }
        ```

1. Once you have your Q# operations defined, use the `%azure.*` magic commands
   to connect and submit jobs to Azure Quantum. You'll use the resource ID of
   your Azure Quantum workspace in order to connect.

    - For example, the following commands will connect to an Azure Quantum
      workspace and execute an operation on the `ionq.simulator` target:

        ```py
        %azure.connect "/subscriptions/.../Microsoft.Quantum/Workspaces/WORKSPACE_NAME"

        %azure.target ionq.simulator

        %azure.execute GenerateRandomBit
        ```

        where `GenerateRandomBit` is the Q# operation that you have already
        defined in the notebook.

1. After submitting a job, you can check its status with `%azure.status` or view
   its results with `%azure.output`. You can view a list of all your jobs by
   running `%azure.jobs`.

Some helpful tips while using Q# Jupyter Notebooks:

- You can run `%lsmagic` to see all of the available magic commands, including
  the Azure Quantum ones.
- Detailed usage information for any magic command can be displayed by simply
  appending a `?` to the command, e.g. `%azure.connect?`.

- Documentation for magic commands is also available online:
  [%azure.connect](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.connect),
  [%azure.target](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.target),
  [%azure.submit](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.submit),
  [%azure.execute](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.execute),
  [%azure.status](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.status),
  [%azure.output](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.output),
  [%azure.jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/qsharp/api/iqsharp-magic/azure.jobs)

## Next steps

Now that you know how to submit jobs to Azure Quantum you can try to run the
[different samples we have available](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs-private/tree/feature/onboarding-azure-quantum/azure-quantum/samples) or try to submit your own
projects. In particular, you can take a look to a [sample written entirely in a Q# Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/quantum-docs-private/blob/feature/onboarding-azure-quantum/azure-quantum/samples/qsharp/parallel-qrng/ParallelQrng.ipynb).
