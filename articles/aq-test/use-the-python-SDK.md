# Use the Python SDK for Quantum Inspired Optimization

This documents provides a basic usage overview of the Python SDK for Quantum
Inspired Optimization. It assumes you have already completed the [Creating an
Azure Quantum Workspace guide](xref:microsoft.azure.quantum.workspaces-portal).

## Installation

The Python SDK is distributed as the `azure-quantum` [PyPI](https://pypi.org)
package. During private preview, you'll need to follow these instructions to
install it from the private Azure Quantum feed:

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.6 or later.
1. Install [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), the Python Package Installer,
   and ensure you have **version 19.2 or higher**
1. Install the `azure-quantum` python package. Note that you will be prompted to
   open a link in your browser and enter a code in order to authenticate.

   ```bash
   pip3 install --upgrade azure-quantum --pre --extra-index-url https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/ms-quantum-public/9af4e09e-a436-4aca-9559-2094cfe8d80c/_packaging/alpha/pypi/simple/
   ```

## Connecting to a Quantum Workspace

A `Workspace` represents the Quantum Workspace you [previously
created](xref:microsoft.azure.quantum.workspaces-portal) and is the main interface for
interacting with the service.

```python
from azure.quantum import Workspace

workspace = Workspace(subscription_id="<subscription-id>", resource_group="<resource-group>", name="<workspace-name>", storage="<storage_connection_string>")
workspace.login()
```

The values for `subscription_id`, `resource_group`, `name`, and `storage` are
output by the
[`quantum-workspace`](https://dev.azure.com/AzureQuantum-PreviewCustomers/PrivatePreview/_git/scripts)
script used while creating the Quantum Workspace. If you lose these values you
run the `quantum-workspace show` with the same arguments you passed during
creation time and it will print out the required values.

When you call `login`, the SDK will see the following printed in your console:

```output
To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code [RANDOM-CODE] to authenticate.
```

Once you complete signing into your Azure account your credentials will be
cached so that you do not have to repeat this process for future runs.

## Expressing and solving a simple problem

To express a simple problem to be solved, create an instance of a `Problem` and
set the [`problem_type` to either `ProblemType.ising` or
`ProblemType.pubo`:

```py
from azure.quantum.optimization import Problem, ProblemType, Term, ParallelTempering

problem = Problem(name="My First Problem", problem_type=ProblemType.ising)
```

Next, create an array of terms and add them to the `problem`:

```py
terms = [
    Term(w=-9, indices=[0]),
    Term(w=-3, indices=[1,0]),
    Term(w=5, indices=[2,0]),
    Term(w=9, indices=[2,1]),
    Term(w=2, indices=[3,0]),
    Term(w=-4, indices=[3,1]),
    Term(w=4, indices=[3,2])
]

problem.add_terms(terms=terms)
```

> Note that there are multiple ways
> to supply terms to the problem, and not all terms must be added at once.

Next, we're ready to solve by applying a solver. In this example we'll use a
parameter-free version of parallel tempering. You can find documentation on this
solver and the other available solvers in the Azure Quantum Provider
Reference.

```py
solver = ParallelTempering(workspace, timeout=100)
```

The solver takes as arguments the `workspace` created previously, plus a single
parameter which is the maximum amount of time (in seconds) to run the solver.
Detailed documentation on parameters is available in the Azure Quantum Provider
Reference.

Solvers provide an `optimize` method that expects a `Problem` which uploads the
problem definition, submits a job, and polls until the job has completed
execution. This is a blocking method that waits for the job to complete
execution. It returns a `JobOutput` object with the job id and results.

```py
result = solver.optimize(problem)
print(result)
```

This method will submit the problem to Azure Quantum for optimization and
synchronously wait for it to be solved. You'll see output like the following in
your terminal:

```
> {'energy': -32.0, 'solution': [1, 1, -1, 1]}
```

## Next Steps

This guide provides an overview of a simple use case. `Problem` also provides
individual methods for `upload` and `submit`; `submit` returns an instance of
the `Job` which exposes the job metadata and `fetch`, `get_output` and `cancel`
methods. These provide more fine grain control for the execution, and are
covered in the next section: Advanced Usage of the Python
SDK.
