# Opening Pull Requests #

All of the documentation for the Quantum Development Kit is managed using the Git version control system through the use of several repositories hosted on GitHub.
Using Git and GitHub together makes it easy to collaborate widely on the Quantum Development Kit.
In particular, any Git repository can be cloned or forked to make a completely independent copy of that repository.
This allows you to work on your contribution with the tools and at a pace that you prefer.

When you're ready, you can send us a request to include your contribution into our repos, using GitHub's _pull request_ functionality.
The page for each pull request includes details of all the changes that make your contribution, a list of comments on your contribution, and a set of review tools that other members of the community can use to provide feedback and advice.

## What is a Pull Request? ##

Having said the above, it's helpful to take a few moments to say what a pull request **is**.
When working with Git, any changes are represented as _commits_ that describe how those changes are related to the state of the repository before those changes.
We'll often draw diagrams in which commits are drawn as circles with arrows from previous commits.

Suppose you have started a contribution in a _branch_ called `feature`.
Then your fork of **Microsoft/Quantum** might look something like this:

If you make your changes in your local repository, you can _pull_ changes from another repository into yours to catch up to any changes that happened upstream.

Pull requests work the same way, but in reverse: when you open a pull request, you ask for the upstream repository to pull your contribution in.

When you open a pull request to one of our repositories, GitHub will offer an opportunity for others in the community to see a summary of your changes, to comment on them, and to make suggestions for how to help make an even better contribution.

Using this process helps us use GitHub functionality to improve contributions and to maintain a high-quality product for the quantum programming community.

## How to Make a Pull Request ##

There are two main ways to make a pull request.
For small changes that only affect a single file, the GitHub web interface can be used to make a pull request entirely online.
For more complicated contributions, it's most often easier to use your local computer to prepare for a pull request first.

<!--
### Using the Web Interface ###

**TODO**

### Command-Line and GitHub Flow ###

Most of the time, it's easier to prepare a pull request on your own computer; that makes it easier to work incrementally, and to test your changes.
If you haven't already done so, the first step is to _fork_ the repository that you'd like to contribute to.
Forking makes a complete clone of the original repository, but under your GitHub account instead of under [Microsoft](http://github.com/Microsoft/) or [MicrosoftDocs](http://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/).
This way, you can edit your personal fork to your heart's content before making a pull request for your work.
