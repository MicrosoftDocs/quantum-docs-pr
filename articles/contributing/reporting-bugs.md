# Reporting Bugs #

If you think you've found a bug in a component of the Quantum Development Kit, we would very much appreciate a report.
After all, someone else may be struggling with the same issue as well; letting us know helps us to get to fixing it for everyone.
The first step in reporting a bug is to start by looking through the existing issues found on each repository, as it's very possible that someone else has reported the same problem.

If the issue has already been found before, it may be helpful to provide additional information or context that can help us to diagnose and solve the problem.
In that case, please feel free to participate in discussions on the issue.

If your bug hasn't been reported before, then we'd appreciate if you open a new issue on the repository for the component in question.
When creating a new issue, you'll be prompted with a template that suggests some information that is often helpful in making informative bug reports:

- Steps to reproduce the problem
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Information about your software environment (e.g.: OS, .NET Core, and Quantum Development Kit versions)

You can also [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) to fix the bug directly, if it's very straightforward and is not worth the discussion (for example, a typo).
