# Develop with Q# and .NET

Q# is built to play well with .NET languages such as C# and F#.
In this guide, we'll demonstrate how to use Q# with a host program written in a .NET language.

## Prerequisites

- Install the Quantum Development Kit [for use with Q# command-line projects](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.standalone).

## Creating a Q# library and a .NET host

The first step is to create projects for your Q# library, and for the .NET host that will call into the operations and functions defined in your Q# library.

### [Visual Studio 2019](#tab/tabid-vs2019)

- Create a new Q# library
  - Go to **File** -> **New** -> **Project**
  - Type "Q#" in the search box
  - Select **Q# Library**
  - Select **Next**
  - Choose a name and location for your library
  - Make sure that "place project and solution in same directory" is **unchecked**
  - Select **Create**
- Create a new C# or F# host program
  - Go to **File** → **New** → **Project**
  - Select "Console App (.NET Core")" for either C# or F#
  - Select **Next**
  - Under *solution*, select "add to solution"
  - Choose a name for your host program
  - Select **Create**

### [Visual Studio Code or Command Line](#tab/tabid-cmdline)

- Create a new Q# library

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new classlib -lang Q# -o quantum
  ```

- Create a new C# or F# console project

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new console -lang C# -o host  
  ```

- Add your Q# library as a reference from your host program

  ```dotnetcli
  cd host
  dotnet add reference ../quantum/quantum.csproj
  ```

- [Optional] Create a solution for both projects

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet new sln -n quantum-dotnet
  dotnet sln quantum-dotnet.sln add ./quantum/quantum.csproj
  dotnet sln quantum-dotnet.sln add ./host/host.csproj
  ```

## Calling into Q# from .NET

Once you have your projects set up following the above instructions, you can call into Q# from your .NET console application.
The Q# compiler will create .NET classes for each Q# operation and function that allow you to run your quantum programs on a simulator.

For example, the [.NET interoperability sample](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/tree/master/samples/interoperability/dotnet) includes the following example of a Q# operation:

:::code language="qsharp" source="~/quantum/samples/interoperability/dotnet/qsharp/Operations.qs" range="67-75":::

To call this operation from .NET on a quantum simulator, you can use the `Run` method of the `RunAlgorithm` .NET class generated by the Q# compiler:

### [C#](#tab/tabid-csharp)

:::code language="csharp" source="~/quantum/samples/interoperability/dotnet/csharp/Host.cs" range="4-":::

### [F#](#tab/tabid-fsharp)

:::code language="fsharp" source="~/quantum/samples/interoperability/dotnet/fsharp/Host.fs" range="4-":::

## Next steps

Now that you have Quantum Development Kit set up for both Q# command-line programs, and for interoperability with .NET, you can write and run [your first quantum program](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstarts.qrng).
