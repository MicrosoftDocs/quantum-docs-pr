# Getting Started with the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit #

A great way to get started with the Quantum Development Kit is via some of the Jupyter notebooks available in our [GitHub Quantum repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum.git).  In particular:

* **[Q# Notebooks](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/tree/master/Samples/src/IntroToIQSharp/Notebook.ipynb)**: explains how to compile and simulate Q# operations inside a Jupyter notebook.
* **[Teleport](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/tree/master/Samples/src/Teleportation/Notebook.ipynb)**: shows how to implement the teleport algorithm using Q#.

To run these interactively, install IQ# on your machine (see below) and take a look at our [Jupyter notebooks getting started guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.jupyter).


## Installing IQ# ##

IQ# (pronounced i-q-sharp) provides the core functionality of compiling and simulating Q# operations.
Installing IQ# on your machine typically takes less than 10 minutes; just follow these two steps:

1. Install the latest version of [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) (2.1 or later) by 
  following the instructions from the [.NET downloads page](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).
2. From the command line, execute:
   ```Command Prompt
   dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.Quantum.IQSharp
   ```

Your installation of the Quantum Development Kit is now complete!

To verify IQ# was correctly installed, from the command line type: `dotnet iqsharp --version`. You should see the IQ# version reported on the output, for example:
```
C:\>dotnet iqsharp --version
Language kernel: 0.5.1903.2501
Jupyter core: 1.1.12077.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> IQ# requires a 64-bit installation of Windows 10, macOS, or Linux.
>
> Microsoft's quantum simulator, installed with the Quantum Development Kit, utilizes Advance Vector Extensions (AVX), 
> and thus can run significantly more efficiently on an AVX-enabled CPU.
> The Quantum Development Kit will still run on nonâ€“AVX enabled CPUs, but may not be as efficient.
> Intel processors shipped in Q1 2011 (Sandy Bridge) or later support AVX.
>
> Microsoft's quantum simulator utilizes OpenMP at runtime, on Linux systems you might need to manually install `libgomp`.

## Updating IQ# ##

To update IQ# to the latest version, from the command line, execute:
```Command Prompt
dotnet tool update -g Microsoft.Quantum.IQSharp
```


## Classical Hosts ##

Applications developed with Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit typically consists of two parts:
1. One or more quantum algorithms, implemented using the Q# quantum programming language.
2. A classical program, implemented in a classical programming language like Python or C#, 
  that serves as the main entry point and will invoke Q# operations 
  when it wants to execute a quantum algorithm.

Once you have installed IQ#, these articles explain how to enable interoperability between Q# and classical languages:

* [C# getting started](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.csharp)
* [Jupyter notebooks getting started](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.jupyter)
* [Python getting started](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.python)

## Editor extensions ##

The Quantum Development Kit offers extensions to [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) 
and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to improve the development experience. 
These extensions are available from [Visual Studio's Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/) 
and provide features like:
* Code colorization and highlighting
* Live diagnostics
* Document symbols
* Documentation on hover
* Signature help
* Go to symbol definition
* Find all references
* Rename of symbols
* Code actions (e.g. namespace import helper)
* Debug breakpoints (Visual Studio)
