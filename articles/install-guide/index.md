# Getting Started with the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit #

If you want to jump straight into Q# with a zero-download experience, you can [try it out online using Jupyter Notebooks](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.tryqonline).
 
To get started working locally in your preferred environment, head to our instructions on [setting up your machine](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.setup). 
 
Once your system is all set up, you can follow our [step-by-step guide to writing your first quantum program](xref:microsoft.quantum.write-program).
