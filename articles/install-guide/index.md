# Getting Started with the Quantum Development Kit

The Quantum Development Kit can be used on a variety of platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac) and with a variety of development environments (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or the command line).  Additionally, Q# quantum programs are executed on one of many target machines provided by the Quantum Development Kit (e.g., full-state simulator, trace simulator or resource estimator).  These target machines can be invoked from any .NET host language, or from Python.   

The Quantum Development Kit can be used either with the Visual Studio 2017 integrated development environment, or a development editor such as Visual Studio Code.
Alternatively, the Quantum Development Kit can be used with the [command line directly](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.cmd-line).  A separate section gives additional information on how to integrate with [Python](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.python).

> [!NOTE]
> The Quantum Development Kit requires a 64-bit installation of Windows 10, macOS, or Linux.
> Microsoft's quantum simulator, installed with the Quantum Development Kit, utilizes Advance Vector Extensions (AVX), and thus can run significantly more efficiently on an AVX-enabled CPU.
> The Quantum Development Kit will still run on nonâ€“AVX enabled CPUs, but may not be as efficient.
> Intel processors shipped in Q1 2011 (Sandy Bridge) or later support AVX.
