# Getting Started with the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit #

## Choose the Environment That's Right for You ##

### Jupyter Notebooks ###

 A great way to get started with Q# before installing the Quantum Development Kit is via some of the Jupyter notebooks available in our [GitHub Quantum repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum.git).  In particular:

* **[Q# Notebooks](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/tree/master/Samples/src/IntroToIQSharp/Notebook.ipynb)** [(Run online)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Microsoft/Quantum/master?filepath=Samples%2Fsrc%2FIntroToIQSharp%2FNotebook.ipynb): explains how to compile and simulate Q# operations inside a Jupyter notebook.
* **[Teleport](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/tree/master/Samples/src/Teleportation/Notebook.ipynb)** [(Run online)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/microsoft/Quantum/master?filepath=Samples%2Fsrc%2FTeleportation%2FNotebook.ipynb): shows how to implement the teleport algorithm using Q#.

To run these locally, take a look at our [Jupyter notebooks getting started guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.jupyter).

### Visual Studio ###

 If you are already a [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) user, you can install the extension to get started developing Q# in Visual Studio. 
> [!div class="button"]
> [Visual Studio extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.DevKit)

Then, check our [quickstart guide](../quickstart?tabs=tabid-vs2017) for step-by-step instructions for your first quantum program.

### Visual Studio Code ###

 If you are already a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) user, you can install the extension to get started developing Q# in Visual Studio Code.
> [!div class="button"]
> [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.quantum-devkit-vscode)

Then, check our [quickstart guide](../quickstart?tabs=tabid-vscode) for step-by-step instructions for your first quantum program.


### Python ###

If you are a Python user, check out our [getting started with Python and the Quantum Development Kit guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.python).

## Installing IQ# ##

IQ# (pronounced i-q-sharp) provides the core functionality of compiling and simulating Q# operations for Jupyter and Python.
Installing IQ# on your machine typically takes less than 10 minutes; just follow these two steps:

1. Install the latest version of [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) (2.1 or later) by 
  following the instructions from the [.NET downloads page](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).
2. From the command line, execute:
   ```Command Prompt
   dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.Quantum.IQSharp
   ```

Your installation of the Quantum Development Kit is now complete!

To verify IQ# was correctly installed, from the command line type: `dotnet iqsharp --version`. You should see the IQ# version reported on the output, for example:
```
C:\>dotnet iqsharp --version
Language kernel: 0.5.1903.2501
Jupyter core: 1.1.12077.0
```

> [!NOTE]
> IQ# requires a 64-bit installation of Windows 10, macOS, or Linux.
>
> Microsoft's quantum simulator, installed with the Quantum Development Kit, utilizes Advance Vector Extensions (AVX), 
> and thus can run significantly more efficiently on an AVX-enabled CPU.
> The Quantum Development Kit will still run on nonâ€“AVX enabled CPUs, but may not be as efficient.
> Intel processors shipped in Q1 2011 (Sandy Bridge) or later support AVX.
>
> Microsoft's quantum simulator utilizes OpenMP at runtime, on Linux systems you might need to manually install `libgomp`.

## Updating IQ# ##

To update IQ# to the latest version, from the command line, execute:
```Command Prompt
dotnet tool update -g Microsoft.Quantum.IQSharp
```

## Classical Hosts ##

Applications developed with Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit typically consists of two parts:
1. One or more quantum algorithms, implemented using the Q# quantum programming language.
2. A classical program, implemented in a classical programming language like Python or C#, 
  that serves as the main entry point and will invoke Q# operations 
  when it wants to execute a quantum algorithm.

Once you have installed IQ#, these articles explain how to enable interoperability between Q# and classical languages:
