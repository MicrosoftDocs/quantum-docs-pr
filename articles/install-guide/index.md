# Install the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK)

Learn how to install the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK), so that you can get started with quantum programming. The QDK consists of:

- the Q# programming language
- a set of libraries that abstract complex functionality in Q#
- a host application (written in Python or a .NET language) that runs quantum operations written in Q#
- tools to facilitate your development

Q# programs are often paired with a host program written in a .NET language (typically C#) or Python. This allows us to call quantum operations from inside a classical program.
In addition, the QDK provides Q# support for Jupyter Notebooks with the IQ# Jupyter kernel.

The QDK is available for multiple development environments. Select your preferred setup from the sections below:

- [Install Q# for Python:](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.python) choose this environment if you want to combine Python and Q# to create a Python host program that calls Q# operations.
- [Install Q# for C#:](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.cs) choose this environment if you want to combine C# and Q# to create a C# host program that calls Q# operations.
- [Install Q# for Jupyter Notebooks:](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.jupyter) choose this environment to execute Q# code in cells with embedded text or create quantum computing interactive tutorials. Do not choose this environment if you want to combine Q# with an external classical host program.
