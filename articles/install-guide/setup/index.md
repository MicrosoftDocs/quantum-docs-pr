# Setup Overview #

To begin writing and running quantum programs on your own computer, follow these instructions for installing the Quantum Development Kit.

## 1. Install .NET Core SDK ##

The Quantum Development Kit uses the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) to make it easy to create, build, and run Q# projects.
Whatever your preferred editor or environment may be, to start working with Q# on your own computer, you will need the latest version (2.2 or later) installed.
You can do this by following the instructions from the [.NET downloads page](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).

## 2. Install the Quantum Development Kit for Your Preferred Environment ##

### Visual Studio Editors and the Command Line ###

After installing the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/), install the Quantum Development Kit following these instructions for your preferred environment:
* [Installing the QDK for Visual Studio Code](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.vs-code) (Windows 10, Linux, macOS)
* [Installing the QDK for Visual Studio](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.vs-2017) (Windows 10 only)
* [Installing the QDK in the command line](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.cmd-line)

### C#, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks ###

In addition to the environments mentioned above, we provide interoperability allowing you to invoke Q# quantum algorithms using C#, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks.
Details and instructions are provided here:
* [Getting started with Q# and C#](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.csharp)
* [Getting started with Q# and Python](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.python)
* [Getting started with Q# and Jupyter Notebooks](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.jupyter)

Once your editor environment is installed and validated, you have all you need to write your first quantum program!
This [step-by-step guide](xref:microsoft.quantum.write-program) takes you through the process.
