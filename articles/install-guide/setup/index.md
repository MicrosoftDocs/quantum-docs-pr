# Setup Overview #

## Install .NET Core SDK ##

The Quantum Development Kit uses the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) to make it easy to create, build, and run Q# projects from the command line. Whatever your preferred editor or environment may be, to start working with Q# on your own computer, you will need the latest version (2.2 or later) installed. You can do this by following the instructions from the [.NET downloads page](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download).

## Install the Quantum Development Kit for Your Preferred Environment ##

### Visual Studio Editors and the Command Line ###

With the .NET Core SDK now installed, you can implement programs in Q# directly in either the command line, or editors such as Visual Studio Code and Visual Studio. To get started, install the Quantum Development Kit Samples and Libraries following these instructions for your preferred environment (links to download the corresponding editors are included within):
* [Installing the QDK for Visual Studio Code](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.vs-code)
* [Installing the QDK for Visual Studio](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.vs-2017)
* [Installing the QDK in the command line](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.cmd-line)

### Classical Hosts ###

If, however, you prefer to work within a classical host environment, we provide interoperability allowing you to implement Q# quantum algorithms using C#, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks. Details and instructions are provided here:
* [Getting started with Q# and C#](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.csharp)
* [Getting started with Q# and Python](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.python)
* [Getting started with Q# and Jupyter Notebooks](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.jupyter)

Once your editor environment is installed and validated, you have all you need to write your first quantum program! This step-by-step guide takes you through the process: [Write Your First Quantum Program](xref:microsoft.quantum.write-program).
