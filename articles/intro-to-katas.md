# Get started with the Quantum Katas

The Quantum Katas are an open source series of self-paced tutorials aimed at teaching you elements of quantum computing and Q# programming at the same time.

## Learning with the Katas

Each kata is a separate project which includes:

* A sequence of tasks on the topic progressing from foundational to challenging. Each task requires you to fill in some code; the first task might require just one line, and the last one might require a sizable fragment of code.
* A testing framework that sets up, runs and validates your solutions. Each task is covered by a unit test which initially fails; once the test passes, you can move on to the next task!
* Pointers to reference materials you might need to solve the tasks, both on quantum computing and on Q#.
* Reference solutions, for when all else fails.

You can develop using the Katas in your environment of choice:

* Jupyter Notebooks online within the Binder environment
* Jupyter Notebooks running on your local machine
* Visual Studio
* Visual Studio Code
