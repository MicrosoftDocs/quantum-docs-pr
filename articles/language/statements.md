# Statements and Other Constructs

## Comments

Comments begin with two forward slashes, `//`,
and continue until the end of line.
A comment may appear anywhere in a Q# source file,
including where statements are not valid.

### Documentation Comments

Comments that begin with three forward slashes, `///`,
are treated specially by the compiler when they appear immediately before
a namespace, operation, specialization, function, or type definition.
In that case, their contents are taken as documentation for the defined
callable or user-defined type, as for other .NET languages.

Within `///` comments, text to appear as a part of API documentation is
formatted as [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax),
with different parts of the documentation being indicated by specially-named
headers.
As an extension to Markdown, cross references to operations, functions and
user-defined types in Q# can be included using the `@"<ref target>"`,
where `<ref target>` is replaced by the fully qualified name of the
code object being referenced.
Optionally, a documentation engine may also support additional
Markdown extensions.

For example:

```qsharp
/// # Summary
/// Given an operation and a target for that operation,
/// applies the given operation twice.
///
/// # Input
/// ## op
/// The operation to be applied.
/// ## target
/// The target to which the operation is to be applied.
///
/// # Type Parameters
/// ## 'T
/// The type expected by the given operation as its input.
///
/// # Example
/// ```Q#
/// // Should be equivalent to the identity.
/// ApplyTwice(H, qubit);
/// ```
///
/// # See Also
/// - Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic.H
operation ApplyTwice<'T>(op : ('T => Unit), target : 'T) : Unit
{
    body(...)
    {
        op(target);
        op(target);
    }
}
```

The following names are recognized as documentation comment headers.

- **Summary**: A short summary of the behavior of a function or operation,
  or of the purpose of a type. The first paragraph of the summary is used
  for hover information. It should be plain text.
- **Description**: A description of the behavior of a function or operation,
  or of the purpose of a type. The summary and description are concatenated to
  form the generated documentation file for the function, operation, or type.
  The description may contain in-line LaTeX-formatted symbols and equations.
- **Input**: A description of the input tuple for an operation or function.
  May contain additional Markdown subsections indicating each individual
  element of the input tuple.
- **Output**: A description of the tuple returned by an operation or function.
- **Type Parameters**: An empty section which contains one additional
  subsection for each generic type parameter.
- **Example**: A short example of the operation, function or type in use.
- **Remarks**: Miscellaneous prose describing some aspect of the operation,
  function, or type.
- **See Also**: A list of fully qualified names indicating related functions,
  operations, or user-defined types.
- **References**: A list of references and citations for the item being
  documented.

## Namespaces

Every Q# operation, function, and user-defined type is
defined within a namespace.
Q# follows the same rules for naming as other .NET languages.
However, Q# does not support relative references to namespaces.
That is, if the namespace `a.b` has been opened, a reference to an operation
names `c.d` will not be resolved to an operation with full name `a.b.c.d`.

Within a namespace block, the `open` directive may be used to allow
abbreviated reference to constructs from another namespace.
The `open` directive applies to the entire namespace block.

A reference to a construct defined in another namespace that is not
opened in the current namespace must be by its fully-qualified name.
For example, an operation named `Op` in the `X.Y` namespace must be
referenced by its fully-qualified name `X.Y.Op`, unless the `X.Y`
namespace has been opened earlier in the current block.
As mentioned above, even if the `X` namespace has been opened, you still
cannot reference the operation as `Y.Op`.

It is usually better to include a namespace by using an `open` directive.
Using a fully-qualified name is required if two namespaces define constructs
with the same name, and the current source uses constructs from both.

## Formatting

Most Q# statements and directives end with a terminating semicolon, `;`.
Statements and directives such as `for` and `operation` that end with
a statement block do not require a terminating semicolon.
Each statement description notes whether the terminating semicolon
is required.

Statements may be broken out across multiple lines.
There must be a line-end between statements,
so it is not possible to have multiple statements on a single line.
Directives and declarations, such as operation declarations,
may also span multiple lines.

## Statement Blocks

Q# statements are grouped into statement blocks.
A statement block starts with an opening `{` and ends with a
closing `}`.

A statement block that is lexically enclosed within another block
is considered to be a sub-block of the containing block;
containing and sub-blocks are also called outer and inner blocks.

## Symbol Binding and Assignment

Q# distinguishes between mutable and immutable symbols.
In general, the use of immutable symbols is encouraged because it
allows the compiler to perform more optimizations.

For arrays, mutability or immutability applies both to the array as a whole
and to array elements.
That is, the elements of an immutable array may not be changed.

The contents of a tuple instance or of a user-defined type based on a tuple
may not be changed regardless of the mutability of the symbol bound to the
instance.
If a mutable symbol is bound to a tuple, the symbol may be bound
to a new tuple, but the existing tuple may not be modified in place.

The arguments to an operation or a function are treated as immutable.
This also applies to elements of an array passed to an operation or function.
This means that Q# does not support "out" variables.

### Tuple Deconstruction

If the right-hand side of the binding is a tuple or a user-defined type,
then an extended syntax may be used to deconstruct the tuple:

```qsharp
let (i, f) = (5, 0.1);
```

This statement will bind `5` to `i` and `0.1` to `f`.

Deconstructing binds may also be used for more complex tuples, such as:

```qsharp
mutable (a, (b, c)) = (1, (2, 3));
set (x, y) = (1, (2, 3));
```

In these examples, `a` and `x` both get bound to `1`,
`b` gets bound to `2`, `c` to `3`, and `y` to `(2, 3)`.

Tuple deconstruction can also be used when the right-hand side of the `=`
is a tuple-valued expression:

```qsharp
let (r1, r2) = MeasureTwice(q1, PauliX, q2, PauliY);
```

### Immutable Symbols

Immutable symbols are bound using the `let` statement.
This is roughly equivalent to variable declaration and initialization in
languages such as C#, except that Q# symbols, once bound, may not be changed;
`let` bindings are immutable.

A simple binding statement consists of the keyword `let`, followed by
an identifier, an equals sign `=`, an expression to bind the identifier to,
and a terminating semicolon.
The type of the identifier is defined to be the same as the type of the
expression it is bound to.

Tuple deconstruction is available with `let` statements.

For example, the statement

```qsharp
let i = 5;
```

binds the symbol `i` as an `Int` with the value `5`.

### Mutable Symbols

Mutable symbols are defined and initialized using the `mutable` statement.
This statement defines a new symbol binding and specifies that the bound value
may be changed later in the code.

A mutable binding statement consists of the keyword `mutable`, followed by
an identifier, an equals sign `=`, an expression to bind the identifier to,
and a terminating semicolon.
The type of the identifier is defined to be the same as the type of the
expression it is bound to.

:new: Tuple deconstruction is available with `mutable` statements.

For example, the statement

```qsharp
mutable counter = 0;
```

defines the symbol `counter` as a mutable `Int` with initial value `0`.

If a mutable symbol is bound to an immutable array, a copy of the array
is created and bound to the symbol.
Modifying the elements of the mutable array will not change the contents
of the original immutable array.

### Updating Mutable Symbols

The value bound to a mutable symbol may be changed by
binding the symbol to a new value using the `set` statement.

A mutable rebinding statement consists of the keyword `set`, followed by
an identifier, an equals sign `=`, an expression to rebind the identifier to,
and a terminating semicolon.
The new value must be compatible with the original type,
and will be promoted to the original type.

:new: Tuple deconstruction is available with `set` statements.

For example, the statement

```qsharp
set counter = counter + 1;
```

increments the `counter` symbol from the `mutable` example.

The `set` statement is also used to set the value of an item
in a mutable array:

```qsharp
set result[1] = One;
```

sets the second element of the `result` array to `One`.
Note that the `result` array must have been defined in a `mutable` statement
for this to be valid.

### Binding Scopes

In general, symbol bindings go out of scope and become inoperative
at the end of the statement block they occur in.
There are two exceptions to this rule:

- The binding of the loop variable of a `for` loop is in scope for
  the body of the for loop, but not after the end of the loop.
- All three portions of a `repeat`/`until` loop (the body, the test,
  and the fixup) are treated as a single scope, so symbols that are
  bound in the body are available in the test and in the fixup.

For both types of loops, each pass through the loop executes in its own scope,
so bindings from an earlier pass are not available in a later pass.

Symbol bindings from outer blocks are inherited by inner blocks.
A symbol may only be bound once per block; it is illegal to bind a symbol
that is already bound.
Thus, the following sequences would be legal:

```qsharp
if (a == b) {
    ...
    let n = 5;
    ...             // n is 5
}
let n = 8;
...                 // n is 8
```

and

```qsharp
if (a == b) {
    ...
    let n = 5;
    ...             // n is 5
} else {
    ...
    let n = 8;
    ...             // n is 8
}
```

But this would be illegal:

```qsharp
let n = 5;
...                 // n is 5
let n = 8;          // Error!!
...
```

as would:

```qsharp
let n = 8;
if (a == b) {
    ...             // n is 8
    let n = 5;      // Error!
    ...
}
...
```

## Control Flow

### For-Loop

The `for` statement supports iteration through a simple integer range
or :new: through an array value.
The statement consists of the keyword `for`, an open parenthesis `(`,
followed by an identifier, the keyword `in`, an expression that
evaluates to a `Range` or an array, a close parenthesis `)`,
and a statement block.
The statement block (the body of the loop) is executed repeatedly,
with the identifier (the loop variable) bound to each value in the
range or array.
Note that if the range expression evaluates to an empty range or array,
the body will not be executed at all.

The expression is fully evaluated before entering the loop,
and will not change while the loop is executing.

For example,

```qsharp
for (index in 0 .. n-2) {
    set results[index] = Measure([PauliX], [qubits[index]]);
}
```

or

```qsharp
for (qb in qubits) {
    H(qb);
}
```

Tuple deconstruction is available with `for` statements if the array
is an array of tuples:

```qsharp
for ((qb, theta) in qubitRotations) {
    Rz(theta, qb);
}
```

The loop variable is bound at each entrance to the loop body, and unbound
at the end of the body.
In particular, the loop variable is not bound after the for loop is completed.

### Repeat-Until-Success Loop

The `repeat` statement supports the quantum “repeat until success” pattern.
It consists of the keyword `repeat`, followed by a statement block
(the _loop_ body), the keyword `until`, a Boolean expression,
the keyword `fixup`, and another statement block (the _fixup_).
The loop body, condition, and fixup are all considered to be a single scope,
so symbols bound in the body are available in the condition and fixup.

Note that the fixup block is required, even if there is no fixup to be done.
In this case, the fixup should be a single expression statement, `()`.

The loop body is executed, and then the condition is evaluated.
If the condition is true, then the statement is completed;
otherwise, the fixup is executed, and the statement is re-executed starting
with the loop body.
Note that completing the execution of the fixup ends the scope for the
statement, so that symbol bindings made during the body or fixup are not
available in subsequent repetitions.

For example, the following code is a probabilistic circuit that implements
an important rotation gate $V_3 = (\boldone + 2 i Z) / \sqrt{5}$ using the
Hadamard and T gates.
The loop terminates in 8/5 repetitions on average.
See [*Repeat-Until-Success: Non-deterministic decomposition of single-qubit unitaries*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1074)
(Paetznick and Svore, 2014) for details.

```qsharp
using (anc = Qubit()) {
    repeat {
        H(anc);
        T(anc);
        CNOT(target,anc);
        H(anc);
        Adjoint T(anc);
        H(anc);
        T(anc);
        H(anc);
        CNOT(target,anc);
        T(anc);
        Z(target);
        H(anc);
        let result = M(anc);
    } until (result == Zero)
    fixup {
    }
}
```

### Conditional Statement

The if statement supports conditional execution.
It consists of the keyword `if`, an open parenthesis `(`, a Boolean
expression, a close parenthesis `)`, and a statement block (the _then_ block).
This may be followed by any number of else-if clauses, each of which consists
of the keyword `elif`, an open parenthesis `(`, a Boolean expression,
a close parenthesis `)`, and a statement block (the _else-if_ block).
Finally, the statement may optionally finish with an else clause, which
consists of the keyword `else` followed by another statement block
(the _else_ block).
The condition is evaluated, and if it is true, the then block is executed.
If the condition is false, then the first else-if condition is evaluated;
if it is true, that else-if block is executed.
Otherwise, the second else-if block is tested, and then the third, and so on
until either a clause with a true condition is encountered or there are no
more else-if clauses.
If the original if condition and all else-if clauses evaluate to false,
the else block is executed if one was provided.

Note that whichever block is executed is executed in its own scope.
Bindings made inside of a then, else-if, or else block are not visible
after the end of the if statement.

For example,

```qsharp
if (result == One) {
    X(target);
} else {
    Z(target);
}
```

or

```qsharp
if (i == 1) {
    X(target);
} elif (i == 2) {
    Y(target);
} else {
    Z(target);
}
```

### Return

The return statement ends execution of an operation or function
and returns a value to the caller.
It consists of the keyword `return`, followed by an expression of the
appropriate type, and a terminating semicolon.

A callable that returns an empty tuple, `()`, does not require a
return statement.
If an early exit is desired, `return ()` may be used in this case
Callables that return any other type require a final return statement.

There is no maximum number of return statements within an operation.
The compiler may emit a warning if statements follow a return statement
within a block.

For example,

```qsharp
return 1;
```

or

```qsharp
return ();
```

or

```qsharp
return (results, qubits);
```

### Fail

The fail statement ends execution of an operation and returns an error value
to the caller.
It consists of the keyword `fail`, followed by a string
and a terminating semicolon.
The string is returned to the classical driver as the error message.

There is no restriction on the number of fail statements within an operation.
The compiler may emit a warning if statements follow a fail statement within
a block.

For example,

```qsharp
fail $"Impossible state reached";
```

or

```qsharp
fail $"Syndrome {syn} is incorrect";
```

## Qubit Management

Note that none of these statements are allowed within the body of a function.
They are only valid within operations.

### Clean Qubits

The using statement is used to acquire new qubits for use
during a statement block.
The qubits are guaranteed to be initialized to the
computational `Zero` state.
The qubits should be in the computational `Zero` state at the
end of the statement block; simulators are encouraged to enforce this.

:new: The statement consists of the keyword `using`, followed by an open
parenthesis `(`, a binding, a close parenthesis `)`, and
the statement block within which the qubits will be available.
The binding follows the same pattern as `let` statements: either a single
symbol or a tuple of symbols, followed by an equals sign `=`, and either a
single value or a matching tuple of values.
The values must all be either a single qubit, indicated as `Qubit()`, or
an array of qubits, indicated by `Qubit[`, an `Int` expression, and `]`.

For example,

```qsharp
using ((ancilla, qubits) = (Qubit(), Qubit[bits * 2 + 3])) {
    ...
}
```

### Dirty Qubits

The borrowing statement is used to allocate qubits for temporary use
during a statement block.
The borrower commits to leaving the qubits in the same state they were in
when they were borrowed.
Such qubits are often known as “dirty ancilla”.
See [*Factoring using 2n+2 qubits with Toffoli based modular multiplication*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07995)
(Haner, Roetteler, and Svore 2017) for an example of dirty ancilla use.

When borrowing qubits, the system will first try to fill the request
from qubits that are in use but that are not accessed during the body
of the `borrowing` statement.
If there aren't enough such qubits, then it will allocate new qubits
to complete the request.

:new: The statement has the same format as the `using` statement, but with the
`using` keyword replaced by `borrowing`.

For example,

```qsharp
borrowing ((ancilla, qubits) = (Qubit(), Qubit[bits * 2 + 3])) {
    ...
}
```

## Expression Evaluation Statements

Any valid Q# expression of type `Unit` may be evaluated as a statement.
This is primarily of use when calling operations on qubits that return `Unit`
because the purpose of the statement is to modify the implicit quantum state.
Expression evaluation statements require a terminating semicolon.

For example,

```qsharp
X(q);
```

or

```qsharp
CNOT(control, target);
```

or

```qsharp
Adjoint T(q1);
```
