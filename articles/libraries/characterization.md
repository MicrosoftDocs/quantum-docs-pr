# Quantum Characterization and Statistics #

In developing quantum algorithms, it is critical to be able to characterize the effects of operations.
This is made challenging by the fact that quantum states cannot be learned directly, reflected in that Q# does not expose or even define what a state *is* to quantum programs.
We thus approach quantum characterization by treating operations and states as black-box; this approach shares much in common with the experimental practice of quantum characterization, verification and validation (QCVV).

## Learning Quantum Processes ##

## Iterative Phase Estimation ##

Viewing quantum programming in terms of quantum characterization suggests a useful alternative to [quantum phase estimation](algorithms#quantum-phase-estimation).

### Bayesian Phase Estimation ###

<!-- FIXME: though RPE is the correct name of this algorithm, in context it reads as though Bayesian PE is the opposite of robust, which is not the case. -->
### Robust Phase Estimation ###
