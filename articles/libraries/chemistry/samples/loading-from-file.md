## Loading a Hamiltonian from file
Previously, we constructed Hamiltonians by adding individual terms to it. While this is fine for small examples, quantum chemistry at scale require Hamiltonians with millions or billions of terms. Such Hamiltonians, generated by chemistry packages such as NWChem, are too large to import by hand. In this sample, we illustrate how a `FermionHamiltonian` instance may be automatically generated from a molecule represented by the [Broombridge schema](xref:microsoft.quantum.libraries.chemistry.schema.broombridge). For reference, one may inspect the provided `LithiumHydrideGUI` sample, or the `RunSimulation` sample. Limited support is also available for importing from the format consumed by [LIQUi|>](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/language-integrated-quantum-operations-liqui/).

Let us consider the example of the Nitrogen molecule, which is provided in the `IntegralData/YAML` folder of the samples repository. The method for loading the `Broombridge` scheme is straightforward.

```csharp
// This is the name of the file we want to load
var filename = @"n2_1_00Re_sto3g.nw.out.yaml";
// This is the directory containing the file
var root = @"IntegralData\YAML";

// This deserializes a Broombridge file, given its filename.
var broombridge = Broombridge.Deserializers.DeserializeBroombridge($@"{root}\{filename}");

// Note that the deserializer returns a list of `ProblemDescription` instances 
// as the file might describe multiple Hamiltonians. In this example, there is 
// only one Hamiltonian. So we use `.First()`, which selects the first element of the list.
var problem = broombridge.ProblemDescriptions.First();

// This extracts the `OrbitalIntegralHamiltonian` from Broombridge format,
// then converts it to a fermion Hamiltonian, then to a Jordan-Wigner
// representation.
var orbitalIntegralHamiltonian = problem.OrbitalIntegralHamiltonian;
var fermionHamiltonian = orbitalIntegralHamiltonian.ToFermionHamiltonian(IndexConvention.UpDown);
var jordanWignerEncoding = fermionHamiltonian.ToPauliHamiltonian(Pauli.QubitEncoding.JordanWigner);
```

The Broombridge schema also contains suggestions for the initial state to be prepared. The labels, e.g. `"|G⟩"` or `"|E1⟩"`, for these states may be seen by inspecting the file. In order to prepare these initial states, the `qSharpData` consumed by the Q# quantum algorithms is obtained similar to the [previous section](xref:microsoft.quantum.chemistry.examples.energyestimate), but with an additional parameter selecting the desired initial state. For instance,
```csharp
// The desired initial state, assuming that a description of it is present in the
// Broombridge schema.
var state = "|E1>";
var wavefunction = problem.Wavefunctions[state].ToIndexing(IndexConvention.UpDown);

// This creates the qSharpData consumable by the Q# chemistry library algorithms.
var qSharpHamiltonianData = jordanWignerEncoding.ToQSharpFormat();
var qSharpWavefunctionData = wavefunction.ToQSharpFormat();
var qSharpData = QSharpFormat.Convert.ToQSharpFormat(qSharpHamiltonianData, qSharpWavefunctionData);
```

All the above steps may be abbreviated using provided convenience methods as follows.
```csharp
// This is the name of the file we want to load
var filename = "...";

// This deserializes a Broombridge file, given its filename.
var broombridge = Broombridge.Deserializers.DeserializeBroombridge(filename);

// Note that the deserializer returns a list of `ProblemDescription` instances 
// as the file might describe multiple Hamiltonians. In this example, there is 
// only one Hamiltonian. So we use `.Single()`, which selects the only element of the list.
var problem = broombridge.ProblemDescriptions.Single();

// This is a data structure representing the Jordan-Wigner encoding 
// of the Hamiltonian that we may pass to a Q# algorithm.
// If no state is specified, the Hartree-Fock state is used by default.
var qSharpData = problem.ToQSharpFormat("|E1>");
```

We may also load a Hamiltonian from the LIQUi|> format, using a very similar syntax. 

```csharp
// This is the name of the file we want to load
var filename = @"fe2s2_sto3g.dat"; // This is Ferrodoxin.
// This is the directory containing the file
var root = @"IntegralData\Liquid";

// Deserialize the LiQuiD format.
var problem = LiQuiD.Deserialize($@"{root}\{filename}").First();

// This is a data structure representing the Jordan-Wigner encoding 
// of the Hamiltonian that we may pass to a Q# algorithm.
var qSharpData = problem.ToQSharpFormat();
```

By following this process from any instance of Broombridge, or any intermediate step, quantum algorithms such as quantum phase estimation may be run on the specified electronic structure problem.
