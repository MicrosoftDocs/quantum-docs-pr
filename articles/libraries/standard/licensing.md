The canon and other libraries, such as the Quantum Chemistry Library, can be obtained from the [Microsoft/QuantumLibraries](https://github.com/Microsoft/QuantumLibraries) repository on GitHub. 

Microsoft's Quantum Development Kit also provides specialized library functions and operations that are licensed under a [Microsoft Research license](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum-nc/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
