# Testing Library #

As with classical development, is is important to be able to diagnose mistakes and errors in quantum programs.
In this section, we discuss the functions and operations provided by the canon to assist in diagnosing quantum operations implemented in Q#, built on top of <xref:microsoft.quantum.primitive.assertprob>.
Many of these functions and operations rely on the fact that classical simulations of quantum mechanics need not obey the [no cloning theorem](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9607018.pdf), such that we can make unphysical measurements and assertions when using a simulator for our target machine.
Thus, we can test individual operations on a classical simulator before deploying on hardware.

## Asserts on Classical Values ##

As discussed in [Testing and Debugging](../quantum-techniques-testinganddebugging.md), a function or operation with signature `() -> ()` or `() => ()`, respectively, can be called as a *unit test*.
Such unit tests are useful in ensuring that functions and operations act as intended in known cases, and that additional features not break existing functionality.
The canon provides several *assertions*: functions which `fail` if their inputs don't meet certain conditions.
For instance, <xref:microsoft.quantum.canon.assertalmostequal> takes inputs `actual : Double` and `expected : Double` and will fail if `(actual - expected)` is outside the range $[-10^{-10}, 10^{-10}]$.
`AssertAlmostEqual` is used within the canon to ensure that functions such as <xref:microsoft.quantum.canon.realmod> return the correct answer for a variety of representative cases.

More generally, the canon provides a range of functions for asserting different properties of and relations between
classical values.
These functions all start with prefix Assert and located in Microsoft.Quantum.Canon namespace.

## Testing Qubit States ##

Suppose that `P : Qubit => ()` is an operation intended to prepare the state $\ket{\psi}$ when its input is in the state $\ket{0}$.
Let $\ket{\psi'}$ be the actual state prepared by `P`.
Then, $\ket{\psi} = \ket{\psi'}$ if and only if measuring $\ket{\psi'}$ in the axis described by $\ket{\psi}$ always returns `Zero`.
That is,
\begin{align}
    \ket{\psi} = \ket{\psi'} \text{ if and only if } \braket{\psi | \psi'} = 1.
\end{align}
Using the primitive operations defined in the prelude, we can directly perform a measurement that returns `Zero` if $\ket{\psi}$ is an eigenstate of one of the Pauli operators.

In the case that our target machine is a simulator, however, we can do better, as described in [Testing and Debugging](../quantum-techniques-testinganddebugging.md).
We can use that the classical information used by a simulator to represent the internal state of a qubit is amenable to copying, such that we do not need to actually perform a measurement to test our assertion.
In particular, this allows us to reason about *incompatible* measurements that would be impossible on actual hardware.

The operation <xref:microsoft.quantum.extensions.testing.assertqubit> provides a particularly useful shorthand to do so in the case that we wish to test the assertion $\ket{\psi} = \ket{0}$.
This is common, for instance, when we have uncomputed to return ancilla qubits to $\ket{0}$ before releasing them.
Asserting against $\ket{0}$ is also useful when we wish to assert that two state preparation `P` and `Q` operations both prepare the same state, and when `Q` supports `Adjoint`.
In particular,

```qsharp
using (register = Qubit[1]) {
    P(register[0]);
    (Adjoint Q)(register[0]);

    AssertQubit(Zero, register[0]);
}
```

More generally, however, we may not have access to assertions about states that do not coincide with eigenstates of Pauli operators.
For example, $\ket{\psi} = (\ket{0} + e^{i \pi / 8} \ket{1}) / \sqrt{2}$ is not an eigenstate of any Pauli operator, such that we cannot use <xref:microsoft.quantum.primitive.assertprob> to uniquely determine that a state $\ket{\psi'}$ is equal to $\ket{\psi}$.
Instead, we must decompose the assertion $\ket{\psi'} = \ket{\psi}$ into assumptions that can be directly tested using  the primitives supported by our simulator.
To do so, let $\ket{\psi} = \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}$ for complex numbers $\alpha = a\_r + a\_i i$ and $\beta$.
Note that this expression requires four real numbers $\{a\_r, a\_i, b\_r, b\_i\}$ to specify, as each complex number can be expressed as the sum of a real and imaginary part.
Due to the global phase, however, we can choose $a\_i = 0$, such that we only need three real numbers to uniquely specify a single-qubit state.

Thus, we need to specify three assertions which are independent of each other in order to assert the state that we expect.
We do so by finding the probability of observing `Zero` for each Pauli measurement given $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and asserting each independently.
Let $x$, $y$, and $z$ be `Result` values for Pauli $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ measurements respectively.
Then, using the likelihood function for quantum measurements,
\begin{align}
    \Pr(x = \texttt{Zero} | \alpha, \beta) & = \frac12 + a\_r b\_r + a\_i b\_i \\\\
    \Pr(y = \texttt{Zero} | \alpha, \beta) & = \frac12 + a\_r b\_i - a\_i b\_r \\\\
    \Pr(z = \texttt{Zero} | \alpha, \beta) &
        = \frac12\left(
            1 + a\_r^2 + a\_i^2 + b\_r^2 + b\_i^2
        \right).
\end{align}

The <xref:microsoft.quantum.extensions.testing.assertqubitstate> implements these assertions given representations of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ as values of type <xref:microsoft.quantum.canon.complex>.
This is helpful when the expected state can be computed mathematically.

## Asserting Equality of Quantum Operations ##

Thus far, we have been concerned with testing operations which are intended to prepare particular states.
Often, however, we are interested in how an operation acts for arbitrary inputs rather than for a single fixed input.
For example, suppose we have implemented an operation `U : ((Double, Qubit[]) => () : Adjoint)` corresponding to a family of unitary operators $U(t)$, and have provided an explicit `adjoint` block instead of using `adjoint auto`.
We may be interested in asserting that $U^\dagger(t) = U(-t)$, as expected if $t$ represents an evolution time.

Broadly speaking, there are two different strategies that we can follow in making the assertion that two operations `U` and `V` act identically.
First, we can check that `U(target); (Adjoint V)(target);` preserves each state in a given basis.
Second, we can check that `U(target); (Adjoint V)(target);` acting on half of an entangled state preserves that entanglement.
These strategies are implemented by the canon operations <xref:microsoft.quantum.canon.assertoperationsequalinplace> and <xref:microsoft.quantum.canon.assertoperationsequalreferenced>, respectively.

> [!NOTE]
> The referenced assertion discussed above works based on the [Choi–Jamiłkowski isomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel-state_duality), a mathematical framework which relates operations on $n$ qubits to entangled states on $2n$ qubits.
> In particular, the identity operation on $n$ qubits is represented by $n$ copies of the entangled state $\ket{\beta_{00}} \mathrel{:=} (\ket{00} + \ket{11}) / \sqrt{2}$.
> The operation <xref:microsoft.quantum.canon.preparechoistate> implements this isomorphism, preparing a state that represents a given operation.

Roughly, these strategies are distinguished by a time–space tradeoff.
Iterating through each input state takes additional time, while using entanglement as a reference requires storing additional qubits.
In cases where an operation implements a reversible classical operation, such that we are only interested in its behavior on computational basis states, <xref:microsoft.quantum.canon.assertoperationsequalinplacecompbasis> tests equality on this restricted set of inputs.

> [!TIP]
> The iteration over input states is handled by the enumeration operations <xref:microsoft.quantum.canon.iteratethroughcartesianproduct> and <xref:microsoft.quantum.canon.iteratethroughcartesianpower>.
> These operations are useful more generally for applying an operation to each element of the Cartesian product between two or more sets.

More critically, however, the two approaches test different properties of the operations under examination.
Since the in-place assertion calls each operation multiple times, once for each input state, any random choices and measurement results might change between calls.
By contrast, the referenced assertion calls each operation exactly once, such that it checks that the operations are equal *in a single shot*.
Both of these tests are useful in ensuring the correctness of quantum programs.
