# The basics of Q#
In this section we will present a brief introduction to the basic building blocks of Q#.
## The simplest quantum program
From a technical perspective, a quantum program can be seen as a particular set of classical functions which, when called, generate quantum circuits as their side effects. An important consequence of that view is that a program written in Q# does not directly model qubits themselves, but rather describes how a classical control computer interacts with those qubits.
By design, Q# thus does not define quantum states or other properties of quantum mechanics directly, but rather does so indirectly through the action of the various subroutines defined in the language.
For instance, consider the state $\ket{+} = \left(\ket{0} + \ket{1}\right) / \sqrt{2}$ discussed in the [Quantum Computing Concepts](xref:microsoft.quantum.concepts.intro) guide.
To prepare this state in Q#, we use the facts that the qubits are initialized in the $\ket{0}$ state, and that $\ket{+} = H\ket{0}$, where $H$ is the Hadamard transform:

```qsharp
using (qubit = Qubit()) {
    // At this point, qubit is in the state |0〉.
    H(qubit);
    // We've now applied H, such that our qubit is in H|0〉 = |+〉, as we wanted.
}
```
## Q# transformation of quantum states

Importantly, in writing the above program, we did not explicitly refer to the state within Q#, but rather described how the state was *transformed* by our program.
Thus, similar to how a graphics shader program accumulates a description of transformations to each vertex, a quantum program in Q# accumulates transformations to quantum states.
This allows us to be entirely agnostic about what a quantum state even *is* on each target machine, which might have different interpretations depending on the machine. 

From the perspective of a Q# program, a qubit is an entirely opaque reference to the internal structure of a target machine.
A Q# program has no ability to introspect into the state of a qubit, its representation on a target machine, or even whether it is the same qubit as any other qubit available to the program.
Rather, a program can call operations such as `Measure` to learn information from a qubit, and call operations such as `X` and `H` to act on the state of a qubit.
These operations have no intrinsic definition within the language, and are made concrete only by the target machine used to run a particular Q# program.
A Q# program recombines these operations as defined by a target machine to create new, higher-level operations to express quantum computation.
In this way, Q# makes it easy to express the logic underlying quantum and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, while also being general with respect to the structure of a target machine or simulator.

## Q# operations and functions

 Concretely, a Q# program is comprised of one or more *operations*, one or more *functions*, and user defined types. Operations are used to describe the transformations of the state of a quantum machine and are the most basic building block of Q# programs. 
 Each operation defined in Q# may then call any number of other operations, including the built-in *intrinsic* operations implemented by a target machine.
 When compiled, each operation is represented as a .NET class type that can be provided to target machines.

 In contrast to operations, functions are used to describe purely classical behavior and do not have any effects besides computing classical output values. Q# is a strongly typed language and comes with a set of built-in primitive types as well as support for user defined types. 

 Throughout the rest of this guide, we will see how to use different language concepts and constructs to help us define complex quantum programs through the basic building blocks of operations, functions, and types.

## Q# syntax overview

 The syntax of a language describes the different combinations of symbols that form a syntactically correct program. In Q# we can classify the elements of its syntax in three different groups: types, expressions and statements.
### Types

 Q# is a strongly-typed language, such that careful use of types can help the compiler to provide strong guarantees about Q# programs at compile time. Q# provides both primitive types, which can be used directly, and a variety of ways to produce new types from other types.
 
### Expressions
An expression in a programming language is a combination of one or more constants, variables, operators, and functions that the programming language interprets and computes to produce another value. For example, `2+3` is an arithmetic and programming expression which evaluates to `5`. Q# has its own expressions and rules.
### Statements 
  A statement is a syntactic unit of an imperative programming language that expresses some action to be carried out. Statements contrast with expressions in that statements do not return results and are executed solely for their side effects, while expressions always return a result and often do not have side effects at all. This distinction is frequently observed in wording: a statement is executed, while an expression is evaluated. An example of a Q# statement is the loop `for` which supports iteration over an integer range.

## Structure fo Q# Source Files

Minimally, a Q# source file consists of a *namespace declaration*, which specifies a .NET namespace which will contain the definitions in the source file.
Definitions from other Q# source files and libraries can be included using the `open` statement.
For instance, most of the operations defining fundamental gates are defined in the <xref:microsoft.quantum.intrinsic> namespace.
To make this available to our code, we simply `open` that namespace at the top of each file:

```qsharp
namespace Example {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;

    // ...
}
```

Within a namespace, each Q# source file can define any combination of *operations*, *functions*, and *user-defined types*.
