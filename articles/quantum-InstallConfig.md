# Installing and Validating the Q# Development Environment

## Required Prerequisites

- A 64-bit installation of Windows, macOS, or Linux. (the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit has been tested under Ubuntu Linux, but may work on other distributions).
- The [.NET Core SDK 2.0](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started) or later.


## Optional Prerequisites

- A development environment with .NET Core support:
    - For Windows: We recommend [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/) and the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.DevKit) extension. You can also use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.microsoft-quantum-development-kit-vscode) extension.
    - For macOS or Linux: We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.microsoft-quantum-development-kit-vscode) extension.
- Microsoft's quantum simulator, installed with the Quantum Development Kit, utilizes Advance Vector Extensions (AVX), and thus can run significantly more efficiently on an AVX-enabled CPU.
  The Quantum Development Kit will still run on nonâ€“AVX enabled CPUs, but may not be as efficient.
  Intel processors shipped in Q1 2011 (Sandy Bridge) or later support AVX.
- Some samples use the Node.js Package Manager (NPM) to handle user interface dependencies.
  NPM can be installed [manually](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) or through a [package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
- The Python interoperability feature has been developed for the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) of Python 3.6.
  Please see the [README](https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum/tree/master/Samples/PythonInterop/README.md) file provided with the Python sample for more details.

#### [Installing Visual Studio 2017 (Windows only)](#tab/tabid-vs2017)

If you do not have Visual Studio installed, you can download Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition for free.
1. Go to the [Visual Studio download page](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/).
1. Click on the Visual Studio Community **Free download** button.
2. Navigate to your browser's download folder and double click on the executable file whose name begins with **vs_community**. The file name will contain a sequence of numbers that varies.
3. _**Important!**_ &nbsp;When you are presented with the option to select the tools for specific workloads, check the box for **.NET Core cross-platform development**. If there are any other workloads you would like to install, you can select them as well at this step.
4. After selecting your workloads, click **Install** to complete the installation.

#### [Installing Visual Studio Code (Windows, macOS, Linux)](#tab/tabid-vscode)

You can download Visual Studio Code for free for your platform.
1. Go to the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
1. Pick the download for your platform and follow the installation prompts.

## Installing and Validating the Q# Development Environment

In this section you will clone the quantum samples & libraries repository, and run a sample application to verify that your Q# environment is correctly installed and configured.

#### [Visual Studio 2017](#tab/tabid-vs2017)

1. Install the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.DevKit) extension.

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Quantum Development Kit does not support Visual Studio for Mac. For development on macOS, we recommend Visual Studio Code.

2. Clone and open the [Microsoft Quantum Developer Kit Samples and Libraries](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum) GitHub repository.
    1. Open Visual Studio.
    2. Open the **Connect** view in **Team Explorer** (`Team` > `Manage Connections`)
    3. Select **Clone** under **Local Git Repositories** and enter `https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum.git`
    4. Click **Clone** to clone the repo.
    5. The repository will be cloned on your local computer and Visual Studio will switch to the **Solution Explorer** on the right populated with the libraries and samples.
    6. Open the `QsharpLibraries.sln` solution.
      - If prompted by the **Install Missing Features** pane, click **Install** to allow the installation of the necessary features. This is most often F# and tools used by some of the samples.

3. Validate your Q# environment by running the teleport sample program:
   1. Right click on the `TeleportationSample` project in `Samples` > `0.Introduction` folder of `QsharpLibraries` solution, and left click on "Set as Startup Project".
   2. Run the solution (F5.)

> [!Tip]
> If you receive a number of errors that reference NuGet packages, use the procedures in [NuGet package restore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/package-restore) to restore the packages.

#### [Command Line / Visual Studio Code](#tab/tabid-vscode)

1. If you intend to use Visual Studio Code, install the [Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quantum.microsoft-quantum-development-kit-vscode) extension.

2. Install the Q# Development Kit project templates.
   From your favorite command line (e.g.: PowerShell or Bash), run the following command:
  ```bash
  $ dotnet new -i "Microsoft.Quantum.ProjectTemplates::0.2-*"
  ```

3. Clone and open the [Microsoft Quantum Developer Kit Samples and Libraries](https://github.com/microsoft/quantum) GitHub repository.
  ```bash
  $ git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/Quantum.git
  ```
  To continue at the command line, navigate into the newly cloned directory:
  ```bash
  $ cd Quantum
  ```
  If you would like to work with the new project in VS Code, run:
  ```bash
  $ code .
  ```
  You may be prompted to install the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Visual Studio Code and the Microsoft C# extension if you haven't already done so.

  > [!TIP]
  > If you are running on macOS and the `code` command is missing, you may need to [install the command line interface for Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/command-line).

4. From the terminal (standalone, or the embedded terminal in Visual Studio Code), run the teleport sample program:
  ```bash
  $ cd Samples/Teleportation/
  $ dotnet run
  ```
****

 If the program runs and the output is similar to the following (has 8 rounds of successful teleportation with varying values True/False sent each round), your Q# environment is ready to support Q# development.

  ```
          Round 0:        Sent True,      got True.
          Teleportation successful!!
          Round 1:        Sent False,     got False.
          Teleportation successful!!
          ...
          Round 6:        Sent True,      got True.
          Teleportation successful!!
          Round 7:        Sent False,     got False.
          Teleportation successful!!
  ```
