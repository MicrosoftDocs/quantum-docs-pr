# Testing and Debugging

As with classical programming, it is essential to be able to check that quantum programs act as intended, and to be able to diagnose a quantum program that is incorrect.
In this section, we cover the tools offered by Q# for testing and debugging quantum programs.

## Unit Tests

One common approach to testing classical programs is to write small programs called *unit tests* which run code in a library and compare its output to some expected output.
For instance, we may want to ensure that `Square(2)` returns `4`, since we know *a priori* that $2^2 = 4$.

Q# supports creating unit tests for quantum programs, and which can be executed as tests within the [xUnit](https://xunit.github.io/) unit testing framework.

### Creating a Test Project

#### [Visual Studio 2017](#tab/tabid-vs2017)

Open Visual Studio 2017. Go to the `File` menu and select `New` > `Project...`.
In the project template explorer, under `Installed` > `Visual C#`,
select the `Q# Test Project` template.

#### [Command Line / Visual Studio Code](#tab/tabid-vscode)

From your favorite command line, run the following command:
```bash
$ dotnet new xunit -lang Q# -o Tests
$ cd Tests
$ code . # To open in Visual Studio Code
```

****

In either case, your new project will have two files open.
The first file, `Tests.qs`, provides a convenient place to define new Q# unit tests.
Initially this file contains one sample unit test `AllocateQubitTest` which checks that a newly allocated qubit is in the $\ket{0}$ state and prints a message:

```qsharp
operation AllocateQubitTest () : ()
{
    body
    {
        using (qs = Qubit[1]) {
            Assert([PauliZ], [qs[0]], Zero, "Newly allocated qubit must be in |0> state");
        }
        Message("Test passed");
    }
}
```

Any Q# operation with the signature `() => ()` or function with the signature `() -> ()` can be executed as a unit test. 

The second file, `TestSuiteRunner.cs` contains a method that discovers and runs Q# unit tests. 
This is the method `TestTarget` annotated with `OperationDriver` attribute.
The `OperationDriver` attribute is a part of the Xunit extension library Microsoft.Quantum.Simulation.Xunit.
The unit testing framework calls `TestTarget` method for every Q# unit test it has discovered.
The framework passes the unit test description to the method through `op` argument. The following line of code:
```csharp
op.TestOperationRunner(sim);
```
executes the unit test on `QuantumSimulator`.

By default, the unit test discovery mechanism looks for all Q# functions or operations with signatures `() => ()` or `() -> ()`
that satisfy the following properties:
* Located in the same assembly as the method annotated with the `OperationDriver` attribute.
* Located in the same namespace as the method annotated with the `OperationDriver` attribute.
* Has a name ending with `Test`.

An assembly, a namespace, and a suffix for unit test functions and operations can be set using optional parameters of the `OperationDriver` attribute:
* `AssemblyName` parameter sets the name of the assembly which is being searched for tests.
* `TestNamespace` parameter sets the name of the namespace which is being searched for tests.
* `Suffix` sets the suffix of operation or function names that are considered to be unit tests.

In addition, the `TestCasePrefix` optional parameter lets you set a prefix for the name of the test case. 
The prefix in front of the operation name will appear in the list of test cases. For example, 
`TestCasePrefix = "QSim:"` will cause `AllocateQubitTest` to appear as `QSim:AllocateQubitTest` in the list 
of found tests. This can be useful to indicate, for instance, which simulator is used to run a test.

### Running Q# Unit Tests

#### [Visual Studio 2017](#tab/tabid-vs2017)

As a one-time per-solution setup, go to `Test` menu and select `Test Settings` > `Default Processor Architecture` > `X64`.

> [!TIP]
> The default processor architecture setting for Visual Studio is stored in the solution options (`.suo`) file for each solution.
> If you delete this file, then you will need to select `X64` as your processor architecture again.

Build the project, go to the `Test` menu and select `Windows` > `Test Explorer`. `AllocateQubitTest` will show up in the list of tests in the `Not Run Tests` group. Select `Run All` or run this individual test, and it should pass!

#### [Command Line / Visual Studio Code](#tab/tabid-vscode)

To run tests, navigate to the project folder (the folder which contains `Tests.csproj`), and execute the command:

```bash
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet test
```

You should get output similar to the following:

```
Build started, please wait...
Build completed.

## Logging and Assertions

One important consequence of the fact that functions in Q# have no side effects is that any effects of executing a function whose output type is the empty tuple `()` can never be observed from within a Q# program.
That is, a target machine can choose not to execute any function which returns `()` with the guarantee that this omission will not modify the behavior of any following Q# code.
This makes functions returning `()` a useful tool for embedding assertions and debugging logic into Q# programs. 

### Logging

The primitive function @"microsoft.quantum.primitive.message" has type `String -> ()` and enables the creation of diagnostic messages.

The `onLog` action of `QuantumSimulator` can be used to define actions performed when Q# code calls `Message`. By default logged messages are printed to standard output.

When defining a unit test suite, the logged messages can be directed to the test output. When a project is created from Q# Test Project template, this redirection is pre-configured for the suite and created by default as follows:

```qsharp
using (var sim = new QuantumSimulator())
{
    // OnLog defines action(s) performed when Q# test calls operation Message
    sim.OnLog += (msg) => { output.WriteLine(msg); };
    op.TestOperationRunner(sim);
}
```

#### [Visual Studio 2017](#tab/tabid-vs2017)

After you execute a test in Test Explorer and click on the test, a panel will appear with information about test execution: Passed/Failed status, elapsed time and an "Output" link. If you click the "Output" link, test output will open in a new window.

![test output](media/unit-test-output.png "Accessing Xunit test output")

#### [Command Line / Visual Studio Code](#tab/tabid-vscode)

The pass/fail status for each test is printed to the console by `dotnet test`.
For failing tests, the outputs logged as a result of the `output.WriteLine(msg)` call above are also printed to the console to help diagnose the failure.

***

### Assertions

The same logic can be applied to implementing assertions. Let's consider a simple example:

```qsharp
function AssertPositive(value : Double) : () {
    if (value <= 0) {
        fail "Expected a positive number.";
    }
}
```

Here, the keyword `fail` indicates that the computation should not proceed, raising an exception in the target machine running the Q# program.
By definition, a failure of this kind cannot be observed from within Q#, as no further Q# code is run after a `fail` statement is reached.
Thus, if we proceed past a call to `AssertPositive`, we can be assured by that its input was positive.

Building on these ideas, [the prelude](./libraries/prelude.md) offers two especially useful assertions, both @"microsoft.quantum.primitive.assert" and @"microsoft.quantum.primitive.assertprob" both modeled as operations onto `()`. These assertions each take a Pauli operator describing a particular measurement of interest, a quantum register on which a measurement is to be performed, and a hypothetical outcome.
On target machines which work by simulation, we are not bound by [the no-cloning theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No-cloning_theorem), and can perform such measurements without disturbing the register passed to such assertions.
A simulator can then, similar to the `AssertPositive` function above, abort computation if the hypothetical outcome would not be observed in practice:

```qsharp
using (register = Qubit[1]) {
    H(register[0]);
    Assert([PauliX], register, Zero);
    // Even though we do not have access to states in Q#,
    // we know by the anthropic principle that the state
    // of register at this point is |+âŒª.
}
```

On physical quantum hardware, where the no-cloning theorem prevents examination of quantum state, the `Assert` and `AssertProb` operations simply return `()` with no other effect.

The <xref:microsoft.quantum.canon> namespace provides several more functions of the `Assert` family which allow us to check more advanced conditions. They are detailed in [Q# standard libraries: Testing and Debugging](libraries/testing.md) section.
## Debugging

Q# supports a subset of standard Visual Studio debugging capabilities: [setting line breakpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/using-breakpoints), [stepping through code using F10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/navigating-through-code-with-the-debugger) and [inspecting values of classic variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/autos-and-locals-windows) during code execution on simulator.
Debugging in Visual Studio Code is not yet supported.
