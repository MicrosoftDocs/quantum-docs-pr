# Install the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK)

Learn how to install the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK), so that you can get started with quantum programming. The QDK consists of:

- The Q# programming language
- A set of libraries that abstract complex functionality in Q#
- APIs for Python and .NET languages (C#, F#, and VB.NET) for running quantum programs written in Q#
- Tools to facilitate your development

Q# programs can run as standalone applications using Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio, or through Jupyter Notebooks with the IQ# Jupyter kernel.
They can also be paired with a host program written in a .NET language (typically C#) or Python, enabling you to call quantum operations from inside a classical program.

The workflows for each of these setups are described and compared at [Ways to run a Q# program](xref:microsoft.quantum.guide.host-programs).

To proceed with installing the QDK and creating Q# projects, select your preferred setup:

[Develop with Q# applications](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.standalone) - Choose this approach to work with Q# from the command prompt. This does not require a driver or a host program like the below options.

[Develop with Q# Jupyter Notebooks](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.jupyter) - Select this environment to run Q# code in cells with embedded text or create quantum computing interactive tutorials. 

[Develop with Q# and Python](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.python) - Enables you to combine Python and Q# to create a Python host program that calls Q# operations.

[Develop with Q# and .NET](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.cs) - Combine C#, F#, or VB.NET with Q# to create a .NET host program that calls Q# operations.
