# Quantum Development Techniques

This section of our documentation details the core concepts used to create quantum programs in Q#, and to interact with those programs from classical .NET applications.
We assume *some* knowledge of quantum computing concepts like those described in [Quantum computing concepts](xref:microsoft.quantum.concepts.intro), but you needn't be an expert in quantum computing to get a lot from these sections.
