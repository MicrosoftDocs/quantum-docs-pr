# Local Variables #

A value of any type in Q# can be assigned to a variable for reuse within an operation or function by using the `let` keyword.
For instance:

```qsharp
let measurementOperator = [PauliX, PauliZ, PauliZ, PauliX, PauliI];
```

This assigns a particular array of Pauli operators to a variable called `measurementOperator`.

> [!TIP]
> Note that we did not need to explicitly specify the type of our new variable, as the expression on the right-hand side of the `let` statement is unambiguous and the type is inferred by the compiler. 

Variables in Q# are *immutable*, meaning that once a variable has been defined in this way, it can no longer be changed in any way.
This allows for several beneficial optimizations, including optimization of the classical logic acting on variables to be reordered for applying the `Adjoint` variant of an operation.

Variables defined using the `let` binding as above are local to a particular scope, such as the body of an operation or the contents of a `for` loop.


## Mutability ##

As an alternative to creating a variable with `let`, the `mutable` keyword will create a special mutable variable that can be re-bound after it is initially created by using the `set` keyword.

```qsharp
operation RandomInts(maxInt : Int, nrSamples : Int) : Int[] {
    mutable samples = new Int[0];
    for (i in 1 .. nrSamples) {
        set samples += [RandomInt(maxInt)];
    }
    return samples;
}
```

All types in Q#, including arrays, follow value semantics. In particular, it is not possible to update array items. To modify an existing array requires leveraging a copy-and-update mechanism much like the one for records in F#. 
Using the library tools for arrays provided in [`Microsoft.Quantum.Arrays`](xref:microsoft.quantum.arrays), we can e.g. easily define a function that returns an array of Paulis where the Pauli at index `i` takes the given value and all other entries are the identity: 

```qsharp
function EmbedPauli (pauli : Pauli, i : Int, n : Int) : Pauli[] {
    
    let arr = ConstantArray(n, PauliI); // creates an array of filled with PauliI
    return arr w/ i <- pauli; // constructs a new array based on arr except that entry i is set to pauli
}
```

We will elaborate more on how to work with arrays when discussing Q# statements and expressions. 

Mutability within Q# is a concept that applies to a *symbol* rather than a type or value. 
Specifically, it does not have a representation in the type system, implicitly or explicitly, and whether or not a binding is mutable (as indicated by the `mutable` keyword) or immutable (as indicated by `let`) does not change the type of the bound variable(s). 
This provides an important way to isolate mutability inside specialized functions and operations.
In particular, even though an adjoint specialization for an operation which uses a mutable variable cannot be auto-generated, auto-generation works fine for an operation calling a function which uses mutability.
For this reason, it is a good practice to make functions and operations which use mutability as short and compact as possible, so that the rest of the quantum program can be written using ordinary immutable variables.


## Deconstruction ##

In addition to assigning a single variable, the `let` and `mutable` keywords - or in fact any other binding construct - also allow for unpacking the contents of a [tuple type](#tuple-types).
An assignment of this form is said to *deconstruct* the elements of that tuple.
For instance, if we model a term in a Hamiltonian by a tuple, then we can use deconstruction to access the different data that we need to simulate under that term:

```qsharp
// Represents H = 3.1 X_0 Z_1.
let (_, (paulis, idxQubits)) = ((3.1, 1.0), ([PauliX, PauliZ], [0, 1])); // paulis and idxQubits are both immutable variables
mutable ((c1, c2), _) = ((3.1, 1.0), ([PauliX, PauliZ], [0, 1])); // c1 and c2 are both mutable variables
```
