# Control Flow in Q#

Within an operation or function, each statement executes in order, similar to most common imperative classical languages.
This flow of control can be modified, however, in three distinct ways:

- `if` statements
- `for` loops
- `repeat`-`until` loops

We defer discussion of the latter to further [below](#repeat-until-success-loop).
The `if` and `for` control flow constructs, however, proceed in a familiar sense to most classical programming languages.

Importantly, `for` loops and `if` statements can even be used in operations for which specializations are auto-generated. In that case the adjoint of a `for` loop reverses the direction and takes the adjoint of each iteration.
This follows the "shoes-and-socks" principle: if you wish to undo putting on socks and then shoes, you must undo putting on shoes and then undo putting on socks.
It works decidedly less well to try and take your socks off while you're still wearing your shoes!

## If, Else-if, Else

The `if` statement supports conditional execution.
It consists of the keyword `if`, an open parenthesis `(`, a Boolean expression, a close parenthesis `)`, and a statement block (the _then_ block).
This may be followed by any number of else-if clauses, each of which consists of the keyword `elif`, an open parenthesis `(`, a Boolean expression, a close parenthesis `)`, and a statement block (the _else-if_ block).
Finally, the statement may optionally finish with an else clause, which consists of the keyword `else` followed by another statement block (the _else_ block).

The `if` condition is evaluated, and if it is true, the then block is executed.
If the condition is false, then the first else-if condition is evaluated; if it is true, that else-if block is executed.
Otherwise, the second else-if block is tested, and then the third, and so on until either a clause with a true condition is encountered or there are no more else-if clauses.
If the original if condition and all else-if clauses evaluate to false, the else block is executed if one was provided.

Note that whichever block is executed is executed in its own scope.
Bindings made inside of an `if`, `elif`, or `else` block are not visible after its end.

For example,

```qsharp
if (result == One) {
    X(target);
    let n = 1;
    // n is bound
} 
// n is not bound
```
or
```qsharp
if (i == 1) {
    X(target);
    let n = 1;
} elif (i == 2) {
    Y(target);
    let m = n + 1; // would cause an error, because n is no longer bound
} else {
    Z(target);
}
```

## For Loop

The `for` statement supports iteration over an integer range or over an array.
The statement consists of the keyword `for`, an open parenthesis `(`, followed by a symbol or symbol tuple, the keyword `in`, an expression of type `Range` or array, a close parenthesis `)`, and a statement block.

The statement block (the body of the loop) is executed repeatedly, with the defined symbol(s) (the loop variable(s)) bound to each value in the range or array.
Note that if the range expression evaluates to an empty range or array, the body will not be executed at all.
The expression is fully evaluated before entering the loop, and will not change while the loop is executing.

The loop variable is bound at each entrance to the loop body, and unbound at the end of the body.
In particular, the loop variable is not bound after the for loop is completed.
The binding of the declared symbol(s) is immutable and follows the same rules as other variable bindings. 

For some examples, supposing `qubits` is a register of qubits (i.e. of type `Qubit[]`), 

```qsharp
// ...
for (qubit in qubits) {  // iterate over each qubit value in the array qubits
    H(qubit);
}
// 'qubit' is no longer bound

mutable results = new (Int, Results)[Length(qubits)];
for (index in 0 .. Length(qubits) - 1) {  // iterates over the integers in the Range 0 .. (Length(qubits) - 1)
    set results w/= index <- (index, M(qubits[index])); // measure each qubit, updates the tuple value in the results array that at index 
}

mutable accumulated = 0;
for ((index, measured) in results) { // iterates over the tuple values in results
    if (measured == One) {
        set accumulated += 1 <<< index;
    }
}
```
Note that at the end we utilized the arithmetic-shift-left binary operator, `<<<`, details of which can be found at [Numeric Expressions](xref:microsoft.quantum.guide.expressions#numeric-expressions)


## Repeat-Until-Success Loop

The Q# language allows classical control flow to depend on the results of measuring qubits.
This capability in turn enables implementing powerful probabilistic gadgets that can reduce the computational cost for implementing unitaries.
As an example, it is easy to implement so-called *Repeat-Until-Success* (RUS) patterns in Q#.
These RUS patterns are probabilistic programs that have an *expected* low cost in terms of elementary gates, but for which the true cost depends on an actual run and an actual interleaving of various possible branchings.

To facilitate Repeat-Until-Success (RUS) patterns, Q# supports the constructs

```qsharp
repeat {
    // do stuff
}
until (expression)
fixup {
    // do other stuff
}
```

where `expression` is any valid expression that evaluates to a value of type `Bool`.
The loop body is executed, and then the condition is evaluated.
If the condition is true, then the statement is completed; otherwise, the fixup is executed, and the statement is re-executed starting with the loop body.

All three portions of a repeat/until loop (the body, the test, and the fixup) are treated as a single scope *for each repetition*, so symbols that are bound in the body are available in the test and in the fixup.
However completing the execution of the fixup ends the scope for the statement, so that symbol bindings made during the body or fixup are not available in subsequent repetitions.

Further, the `fixup` statement is often useful but not always necessary.
In cases that it is not needed, the construct
```qsharp
repeat {
    // do stuff
}
until (expression);
```
is also a valid RUS pattern.

At the bottom of this page we present some [examples of RUS loops](#repeat-until-success-examples).

> [!TIP]   
> Avoid using repeat-until-success loops inside functions. 
> The corresponding functionality is provided by while loops in functions. 

## While Loop

Repeat-until-success patterns have a very quantum-specific connotation. They are widely used in particular classes of quantum algorithms -- hence the dedicated language construct in Q#. 
However, loops that break based on a condition and whose execution length is thus unknown at compile time need to be handled with particular care in a quantum runtime. 
Their use within functions on the other hand is unproblematic, since these only contain code that will be executed on conventional (non-quantum) hardware. 

Q# therefore supports to use of while loops within functions only. 
A `while` statement consists of the keyword `while`, an open parenthesis `(`,
a condition (i.e. a Boolean expression), a close parenthesis `)`, and a statement block.
The statement block (the body of the loop) is executed as long as the condition evaluates to `true`.

```qsharp
// ...
mutable (item, index) = (-1, 0);
while (index < Length(arr) && item < 0) { 
    set item = arr[index];
    set index += 1;
}
```


## Return Statement

The return statement ends execution of an operation or function
and returns a value to the caller.
It consists of the keyword `return`, followed by an expression of the
appropriate type, and a terminating semicolon.

A callable that returns an empty tuple, `()`, does not require a
return statement.
If an early exit is desired, `return ()` may be used in this case.
Callables that return any other type require a final return statement.

There is no maximum number of return statements within an operation.
The compiler may emit a warning if statements follow a return statement
within a block.

For example,
```qsharp
return 1;
```
or
```qsharp
return ();
```
or
```qsharp
return (results, qubits);
```

## Fail Statement

The fail statement ends execution of an operation and returns an error value to the caller.
It consists of the keyword `fail`, followed by a string and a terminating semicolon.
The string is returned to the classical driver as the error message.

There is no restriction on the number of fail statements within an operation.
The compiler may emit a warning if statements follow a fail statement within a block.

For example,
```qsharp
fail $"Impossible state reached";
```
or, using [interpolated strings](xref:microsoft.quantum.guide.expressions#interpolated-strings),
```qsharp
fail $"Syndrome {syn} is incorrect";
```

## Repeat-Until-Success Examples

### RUS pattern for single qubit rotation about an irrational axis 

In a typical use case, the following Q# operation implements a rotation around an irrational axis of $(I + 2i Z)/\sqrt{5}$ on the Bloch sphere. This is accomplished by using a known RUS pattern:

```qsharp
operation ApplyVRotationUsingRUS(qubit : Qubit) : Unit {
    using (controls = Qubit[2]) {
        ApplyToEachA(H, controls);
        mutable finished = false;
        repeat {
            Controlled X(controls, qubit);
            S(qubit);
            Controlled X(controls, qubit);
            Z(qubit);
        }
        until (finished)
        fixup {
            if (MeasureIfAllQubitsAreZero(controls, PauliX)) {
                set finished = true;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### RUS loop with mutable variable in scope

This example shows the use of a mutable variable `finished` which is in scope of the entire repeat-until-fixup loop and which gets initialized before the loop and updated in the fixup step.

```qsharp
mutable iter = 1;
repeat {
    ProbabilisticCircuit(qubits);
    let success = ComputeSuccessIndicator(qubits);
}
until (success || iter > maxIter)
fixup {
    iter += 1;
    ComputeCorrection(qubits);
}
```

### RUS without `fixup`

For example, the following code is a probabilistic circuit that implements an important rotation gate $V_3 = (\boldone + 2 i Z) / \sqrt{5}$ using the `H` and `T` gates.
The loop terminates in $\frac{8}{5}$ repetitions on average.
See [*Repeat-Until-Success: Non-deterministic decomposition of single-qubit unitaries*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1074) (Paetznick and Svore, 2014) for more details.

```qsharp
using (qubit = Qubit()) {
    repeat {
        H(qubit);
        T(qubit);
        CNOT(target, qubit);
        H(qubit);
        Adjoint T(qubit);
        H(qubit);
        T(qubit);
        H(qubit);
        CNOT(target, qubit);
        T(qubit);
        Z(target);
        H(qubit);
        let result = M(qubit);
    } until (result == Zero);
}
```

### RUS to prepare a quantum state

Finally, we show an example of a RUS pattern to prepare a quantum state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\sqrt{2}\ket{0}+\ket{1}\right)$, starting from the $\ket{+}$ state.
See also the [unit testing sample provided with the standard library](https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/blob/master/samples/diagnostics/unit-testing/RepeatUntilSuccessCircuits.qs):

```qsharp
operation PrepareStateUsingRUS(target : Qubit) : Unit {
    using (auxiliary = Qubit()) {
        H(auxiliary);
        repeat {
            // We expect the target and auxiliary qubits to each be in
            // the |+> state.
            AssertProb(
                [PauliX], [target], Zero, 1.0,
                "target qubit should be in the |+> state", 1e-10 );
            AssertProb(
                [PauliX], [auxiliary], Zero, 1.0,
                "auxiliary qubit should be in the |+> state", 1e-10 );

            Adjoint T(auxiliary);
            CNOT(target, auxiliary);
            T(auxiliary);

            // The probability of measuring |+> state on the auxiliary qubit
            // is 3/4.
            AssertProb(
                [PauliX], [auxiliary], Zero, 3. / 4.,
                "Error: the probability to measure |+> in the first
                auxiliary must be 3/4",
                1e-10);

            // If we get the measurement outcome Zero, we prepare the
            // required state.
            let outcome = Measure([PauliX], [auxiliary]);
        }
        until (outcome == Zero)
        fixup {
            // Bring the auxiliary and target qubits back to |+> state.
            if (outcome == One) {
                Z(auxiliary);
                X(target);
                H(target);
            }
        }
        // Return the auxiliary qubit back to the Zero state.
        H(auxiliary);
    }
}
```

Notable programmatic features shown in this operation are a more complex `fixup` part of the loop, which involves quantum operations, and the use of `AssertProb` statements to ascertain the probability of measuring the quantum state at certain specified points in the program.
