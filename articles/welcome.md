# Get started with the Quantum Development Kit (QDK)

Welcome to the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit!  Here, you will find all the tools you need to learn about quantum programming with Q#.  To guide you in learning quantum computing with Q#, we provide this Getting Started Guide, a journey guide for both those of you who want to start coding quantum programs, and people who are not yet ready to start coding but want to learn more about Q# and quantum programming.

## Questions about quantum computing

We begin with a series of short articles that summarize the _questions about quantum computing_. These short articles offer a quick overview of quantum computing for the new learner.

[What is quantum computing?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.what)

[What can quantum computers do?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.computers)

[Why learn quantum computing?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.why)

[What is Q#?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.qsharp)

## How to learn quantum computing with Q#?

Q# and the Quantum Development Kit gives you the tools you need to develop programs for quantum computing that will solve our most challenging problems in computing.

For the fifth question:  "_How to learn quantum computing with Q#?_", we begin by providing these overviews:

* a Getting Started guide on how to build a [quantum random number generator](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstarts.qrng) guides you on installing the QDK and writing your first Q# program along with a brief introduction to quantum concepts. The random number generator is a "Q# Hello World" style application, letting you build and run a quantum application in minutes.

* a Getting Started guide on [quantum basics with Q#](xref:microsoft.quantum.write-program) guides you on writing a Q# program that demonstrates some of the foundational concepts of quantum programming. If you are not ready to start coding, you can still follow along without installing the QDK and get an overview of the Q# programming language and the first concepts of quantum computing.

* a Getting Started guide, [Grover’s search](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstarts.search), offers an example of a Q# program to get an idea of the power of Q# for expressing the quantum algorithm in a way that abstracts the low-level quantum operations.  The Grover's search quickstart guides you in developing the program using a variety of programming environments (with a Python host or with .NET language host and with Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code).

* a [video](https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE2JOJf) to learn more about building quantum programs with the Q# libraries.  The QDK comes with Q# standard and numerics libraries that provide powerful computational abstractions that help you develop these solutions. We also provide the Quantum Chemistry Library, a Q# a library for modeling chemical processes at the quantum level.

## Next steps

The Getting Started guides and articles above are meant to guide both the coder and non-coder through an introduction to quantum computing and Q#.  To continue to learn how to program quantum computers with Q#:

* [How to learn quantum computing with Q#](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.learn) provides guidance for learning quantum computing concepts with Q#.

* Learn quantum programming with our [self-paced Quantum Katas](https://aka.ms/try-quantum-katas). This series of short training exercises teach you how to program in Q# and learn quantum computing.

* Explore our [Q# samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?languages=qsharp) and discover the problems you can solve with quantum computing.

* Develop on a local machine with the host programming language and development environment of your choice:
  * Develop with [Q# + Python](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.python)
  * Develop with [Q# + C#](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.cs)
  * Develop with [Jupyter Notebooks](xref:microsoft.quantum.install.jupyter)

* Become part of the Microsoft Quantum community by contributing to the [QDK](xref:microsoft.quantum.contributing) open source project.
