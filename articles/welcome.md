# Get started with Microsoft Quantum and the Quantum Development Kit (QDK)

Microsoft Quantum, and the QDK give you the tools to program quantum algorithms, and learn quantum computing. We provide you with a multitude of learning journeys and examples.

You can read up about how quantum computing works and what quantum computers can do.

You can dive right in and write a quantum program using our quickstarts, tutorials and online katas (training exercises).

You can learn about the libraries that are provided with the QDK.

## Five things you should know about quantum computing

[What is quantum computing?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.what)

[What can I do with a quantum computer?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.computers)

[Why should I learn quantum computing?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.why)

[How can I learn quantum computing?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.learn)

[What is the Q# programming language?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.qsharp)

## Code first

Dive into a 5-minute [quickstart](xref:microsoft.quantum.write-program) to code a Bell state.

Implement [Grover's search algorithm](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstarts.search) in just a few lines of code.

Try one of the [Quantum Katas](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.katas), short training exercises to teach you how to program in Q# and learn quantum computing.

Browse the [Q# samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/browse/?languages=qsharp)

## Learn about the libraries

In addition to the standard and numeric Q# libraries, the QDK includes libraries that abstract scenario specific functionality, to make it easier for you to write quantum programs that target that scenario. For example, [Quantum Chemistry](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2018/12/04/simulating-nature-with-the-new-microsoft-quantum-development-kit-chemistry-library/) is a library for modeling chemical processes at the quantum level.

Watch this [video](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RE2JOJf) to learn more about the chemistry library.

## Next steps

* You can [try the Quantum Katas directly in your browser](https://aka.ms/try-quantum-katas)
* Develop on your local machine with the host programming language and development environment of choice:
  * Develop with [Python](xref:microsoft.quantum.install#develop-with-python)
  * Develop with [Visual Studio](xref:microsoft.quantum.install#develop-with-c-on-windows-using-visual-studio)
  * Develop with [Visual Studio Code](xref:microsoft.quantum.install#develop-with-c-using-vs-code)
  * Develop with [Jupyter Notebooks](xref:microsoft.quantum.install#develop-with-jupyter-notebooks)
* Become part of the Microsoft Quantum community by contributing to the [QDK](xref:microsoft.quantum.contributing) open source project
