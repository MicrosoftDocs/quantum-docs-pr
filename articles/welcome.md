# Getting started with Microsoft Quantum and the Quantum Development Kit (QDK)

Microsoft quantum and the QDK with its Q# language give you the ability to program quantum algorithms, and learn quantum computing. We provide you with a multitude of learning journeys and examples.

You can read up about how quantum computing works and what quantum computers can do.

You can dive right in and write a quantum program using our quickstarts, tutorials and online katas (training exercises).

You can learn about the libraries that are provided with the QDK.

## Five things you should know about quantum computing

[What is quantum computing](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.whatis)

[What can I do with a quantum computer?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.computer)

[Why should I learn quantum computing](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.why)

[How can I learn quantum computing](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.learn)

[What is the Q# programming language?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.qsharp)

## Code first

Dive into a 5-minute [quickstart](xref:microsoft.quantum.write-program) to code a Bell state.

Implement [Grover's algorithm](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstart.grover) in just a few lines of code.

Try one of the [Quantum Katas](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.katas), short training exercises to teach you how to program in Q# and learn quantum computing.

## Learn about the libraries

Included in the QDK are a set of libraries that abstract scenario specific functionality, to make it easier for you to write quantum programs that target that scenario. For example, [Quantum Chemistry](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2018/12/04/simulating-nature-with-the-new-microsoft-quantum-development-kit-chemistry-library/
) is a library for modeling chemical processes at the quantum level. 

Watch this [video](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RE2JOJf) to learn more about the chemistry library.

## Go deeper

* Introduction to the [katas](link to new page)
* Develop on your local machine with the host programming language and development environment of choice:
  * Develop with [Python](~/install-guide/install.md#develop-with-python)
  * Develop with [Visual Studio](~/install-guide/install.md#develop-with-visual-studio)
  * Develop with [Visual Studio Code](~/install-guide/install.md#develop-with-visual-studio-code)
  * Develop with [Jupyter Notebooks](~/install-guide/install.md#develop-with-jupter-notebooks)
* Become part of the [Microsoft Quantum community](xref:microsoft.quantum.contributing)
