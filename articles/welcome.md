# Get started with Microsoft Quantum and the Quantum Development Kit (QDK)

Welcome to the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit!  Here, you will find all the tools you need to learn about quantum programming with Q#.  To guide you in learning quantum computing with Q#, here we provide a Getting Started Guide, a journey guide for both those who want to start coding quantum programs and those who are not yet ready to start coding, but want to learn more about Q# and quantum programming.

## Five things you should know about quantum computing

We begin with a series short articles that summarizes the _Five things you should know about quantum computing_. These short articles offer a quick overview of quantum computing for the new learner.

[What is quantum computing?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.what)

[What can I do with a quantum computer?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.computers)

[Why should I learn quantum computing?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.why)

[What is the Q# programming language?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.qsharp)

[How can I learn quantum computing?](xref:microsoft.quantum.overview.learn)

## Tutorials to get you started learning and coding

Next, we provide a short tutorial of how to [write your first Q# program](xref:microsoft.quantum.write-program). If you are ready to start coding, this tutorial guides you on installing the QDK and writing your first Q# program that demonstrates some of the first concepts of quantum programming. If you are not ready to start coding, you can still follow along with the tutorial without installing the QDK and get an overview of the Q# programming language and the first concepts of quantum computing.

The second tutorial, [Grover’s search](xref:microsoft.quantum.quickstarts.search), offers a nice example of a Q# program that demonstrates the different way of solving real problems with quantum computing.  With this tutorial, you get a sense of how different quantum computing is from classical computing and you get an idea of the power of Q# for expressing the quantum algorithm in a way that abstracts the low level quantum operations.  Again, if you want to start coding, this tutorial guides you in developing the program using a variety of programming environments (with a Python host or with .NET language host and with Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code).  If you are not a coder, you don’t have to install the QDK.  Just follow along the tutorial to get a sense of the nature of quantum computing with Q#.  

## Learn about the libraries

The Q# and the Quantum Development Kit gives you the tools you need to develop programs for quantum computing that will solve our most challenging problems in computing. The QDK comes with Q# standard and numerics libraries that provide powerful computational abstractions that help you develop these solutions. We also provide the Quantum Chemistry Library, a Q# a library for modeling chemical processes at the quantum level.

Watch this [video](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RE2JOJf) to learn more about the chemistry library.

## Next steps

The tutorials and articles above are meant to guide both the coder and non-coder through an introduction to quantum computing and Q#.  When you’re ready to continue to learn how to program quantum computers with Q#, here are the next steps:

* Learn quantum programming with our [self-paced Quantum Katas](https://aka.ms/try-quantum-katas). This series of short training exercises teach you how to program in Q# and learn quantum computing.  
* Explore our [Q# samples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/browse/?languages=qsharp) and discover the problems you can solve with quantum computing.
* Develop on your local machine with the host programming language and development environment of choice:
  * Develop with [Python](xref:microsoft.quantum.install#develop-with-python)
  * Develop with [Visual Studio](xref:microsoft.quantum.install#develop-with-c-on-windows-using-visual-studio)
  * Develop with [Visual Studio Code](xref:microsoft.quantum.install#develop-with-c-using-vs-code)
  * Develop with [Jupyter Notebooks](xref:microsoft.quantum.install#develop-with-jupyter-notebooks)
* Become part of the Microsoft Quantum community by contributing to the [QDK](xref:microsoft.quantum.contributing) open source project
