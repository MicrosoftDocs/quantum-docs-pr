summary: |-
  Inverts a given target qubit if and only if both control qubits are in the 1 state,
  using measurement to perform the adjoint operation.

  Inverts `target` if and only if both controls are 1, but assumes that
  `target` is in state 0.  The operation has T-count 4, T-depth 2 and
  requires no helper qubit, and may therefore be preferable to a CCNOT
  operation, if `target` is known to be 0.  The adjoint of this operation
  is measurement based and requires no T gates.

  The controlled application of this operation requires no helper qubit,
  `2^c` `Rz` gates and is not optimized for depth, where `c` is the number
  of overall control qubits including the two controls from the `ApplyAnd`
  operation.  The adjoint controlled application requires `2^c - 1` `Rz`
  gates (with an angle twice the size of the non-adjoint operation), no
  helper qubit and is not optimized for depth.
