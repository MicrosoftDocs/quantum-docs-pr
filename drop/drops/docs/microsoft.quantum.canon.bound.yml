summary: |-
  Given an array of operations acting on a single input,
  produces a new operation that
  performs each given operation in sequence.
examples: |-
  The following are equivalent:

  ```qsharp
  let bound = Bound([U, V]);
  bound(x);
  ```

  and

  ```qsharp
  U(x); V(x);
  ```

input:
  content: "(operations : ('T => Unit)[])"
