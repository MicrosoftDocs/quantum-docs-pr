uid: microsoft.quantum.canon.boundca
name: BoundCA
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: |-
  Given an array of operations acting on a single input,
  produces a new operation that
  performs each given operation in sequence.
  The modifier `CA` indicates that all operations in the array are adjointable
  and controllable.
examples: |-
  The following are equivalent:

  ```qsharp
  let bound = BoundCA([U, V]);
  bound(x);
  ```

  and

  ```qsharp
  U(x); V(x);
  ```
syntax: "function BoundCA (operations : ('T => Unit is Adj + Ctl)[]) : ('T => Unit is Adj + Ctl)"
input:
  content: "(operations : ('T => Unit is Adj + Ctl)[])"
  types:
  - name: operations
    summary: A sequence of operations to be performed on a given input.
