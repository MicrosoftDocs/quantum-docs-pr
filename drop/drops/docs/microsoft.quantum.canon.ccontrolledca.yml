summary: |-
  Given an operation op, returns a new operation which
  applies the op if a classical control bit is true. If `false`, nothing happens.
  The modifier `CA` indicates that the operation is controllable and adjointable.
syntax: "function CControlledCA (op : ('T => Unit is Ctl + Adj)) : ((Bool, 'T) => Unit is Ctl + Adj)"

  content: "(op : ('T => Unit is Ctl + Adj))"
