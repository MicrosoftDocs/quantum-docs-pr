uid: microsoft.quantum.canon.cx
name: CX
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: |-
  Applies the controlled-X (CX) gate to a pair of qubits.

  $$
  \begin{align}
  1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\
  0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\
  0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0
  \end{align},
  $$
  where rows and columns are organized as in the quantum concepts guide.
remarks: |-
  Equivalent to:

  ```qsharp
  Controlled X([control], target);
  ```

  and to:

  ```qsharp
  CNOT(control, target);
  ```
syntax: 'operation CX (control : Qubit, target : Qubit) : Unit'
input:
  content: '(control : Qubit, target : Qubit)'

  - name: control
    summary: Control qubit for the CX gate.
