uid: microsoft.quantum.canon.decomposedintotimestepsca
name: DecomposedIntoTimeStepsCA
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: |-
  Returns an operation implementing the Trotter–Suzuki integrator for
  a given operation.
remarks: |-
  When called with `order` equal to `1`, this function returns an operation
  that can be simulated by the lowest-order Trotter–Suzuki integrator
  $$
  \begin{align}
  S_1(\lambda) = \prod_{j = 1}^{m} e^{H_j \lambda},
  \end{align}
  $$
  where we have followed the notation of
  [quant-ph/0508139](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508139)
  and let $\lambda$ be the evolution time (represented by the first input
  of the returned operation), and have let $\{H_j\}_{j = 1}^{m}$ be the
  set of (skew-Hermitian) dynamical generators being integrated such that
  `op(j, lambda, _)` is simulated by the unitary operator
  $e^{H_j \lambda}$.

  Similarly, an `order` of `2` returns the second-order symmetric
  Trotter–Suzuki integrator
  $$
  \begin{align}
  S_2(\lambda) = \prod_{j = 1}^{m} e^{H_k \lambda / 2}
  \prod_{j' = m}^{1} e^{H_{j'} \lambda / 2}.
  \end{align}
  $$

  Higher even values of `order` are implemented using the recursive
  construction of [quant-ph/0508139](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0508139).
