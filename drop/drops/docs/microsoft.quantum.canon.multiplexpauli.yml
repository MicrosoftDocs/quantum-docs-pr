type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: |-
  Applies a Pauli rotation conditioned on an array of qubits.

  This applies a multiply controlled unitary operation that performs
  rotations by angle $\theta_j$ about single-qubit Pauli operator $P$
  when controlled by the $n$-qubit number state $\ket{j}$.
  In particular, the action of this operation is represented by the
  unitary

  $$
  \begin{align}
  U = \sum^{2^n - 1}_{j=0} \ket{j}\bra{j} \otimes e^{i P \theta_j}.
  \end{align}

remarks: |-
  `coefficients` will be padded with elements $\theta_j = 0.0$ if
  fewer than $2^n$ are specified.
