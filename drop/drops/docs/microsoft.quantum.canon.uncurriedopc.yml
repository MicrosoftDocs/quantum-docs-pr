name: UncurriedOpC
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Canon
summary: |-
  Given a function which returns operations,
  returns a new operation which takes both inputs
  as a tuple.
  The modifier `C` indicates that the operations are controllable.
syntax: "function UncurriedOpC (curriedOp : ('T -> ('U => Unit is Ctl))) : (('T, 'U) => Unit is Ctl)"
input:
  content: "(curriedOp : ('T -> ('U => Unit is Ctl)))"
  types:
  - name: curriedOp
    summary: A function which returns operations.

      A new operation `op` such that `op(t, u)` is equivalent
      to `(curriedOp(t))(u)`.
