uid: microsoft.quantum.core.rangeend
name: RangeEnd
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Core
summary: |-
  Returns the defined end value of the given range,
  which is not necessarily the last element in the sequence.
remarks: |-
  A range expression's first element is `start`,
  its second element is `start+step`, third element is `start+step+step`, etc.,
  until `end` is passed.

  Note that the defined end value of a range can differ from the last element in the sequence specified by the range;
  for example, in a range 0 .. 2 .. 5 the last element is 4 but the end value is 5.
