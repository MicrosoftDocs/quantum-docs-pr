type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics
summary: |-
  Given two operations, asserts that they act identically for all input states.

  This assertion is implemented by checking the action of the operations
  on all states of the form $V_0 \otimes ... \otimes V_{n-1}$, where
  $V_k$ is one of the states $\ket{0}$, $\ket{1}$, $\ket{+}$ and $\ket{i}$ (+1 eigenstate of Pauli Y operator).

  This assertion uses $n$ qubits and requires multiple calls of the operations being compared.
syntax: 'operation AssertOperationsEqualInPlace (nQubits : Int, givenU : (Qubit[] => Unit), expectedU : (Qubit[] => Unit is Adj)) : Unit'
references: |-
  The basis of states $\ket{0}$, $\ket{1}$, $\ket{+}$ and $\ket{i}$ is the Chuang-Nielsen basis,
  described in [ *I. L. Chuang, M. A. Nielsen* ](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9610001).
