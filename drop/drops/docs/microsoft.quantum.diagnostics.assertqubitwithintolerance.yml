uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.assertqubitwithintolerance
name: AssertQubitWithinTolerance
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics
summary: |-
  Asserts that the qubit `q` is in the expected eigenstate of the Pauli Z operator up to
  a given tolerance.
remarks: |-
  <xref:microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.assertqubitisinstatewithintolerance> allows for asserting
  arbitrary qubit states rather than only $Z$ eigenstates.
syntax: 'operation AssertQubitWithinTolerance (expected : Result, q : Qubit, tolerance : Double) : Unit'
input:
  content: '(expected : Result, q : Qubit, tolerance : Double)'
  types:
  - name: expected
    summary: 'Which state the qubit is expected to be in: `Zero` or `One`.'
