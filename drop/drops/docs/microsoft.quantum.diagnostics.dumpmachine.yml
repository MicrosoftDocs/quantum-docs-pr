uid: microsoft.quantum.diagnostics.dumpmachine
name: DumpMachine
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Diagnostics
summary: Dumps the current target machine's status.
remarks: |-
  This method allows you to dump information about the current status of the
  target machine into a file or some other location.
  The actual information generated and the semantics of `location`
  are specific to each target machine. However, providing an empty tuple as a location (`()`)
  or just omitting the `location` parameter typically means to generate the output to the console.

  For the local full state simulator distributed as part of the
  Quantum Development Kit, this method  expects a string with
  the path to a file in which it will write the wave function as a
  one-dimensional array of complex numbers, in which each element represents
  the amplitudes of the probability of measuring the corresponding state.
