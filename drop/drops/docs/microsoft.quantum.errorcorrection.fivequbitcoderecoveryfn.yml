uid: microsoft.quantum.errorcorrection.fivequbitcoderecoveryfn
name: FiveQubitCodeRecoveryFn
type: function
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.ErrorCorrection
summary: |-
  Returns function that maps error syndrome measurements to the
  appropriate error-correcting Pauli operators by table lookup for
  the ⟦5, 1, 3⟧ quantum code.
remarks: |-
  By iterating over all errors of weight $1$, we obtain a total of $3\times 5=15$ possible non-trivial syndromes.
  Together with the identity, a table of error and corresponding syndrome is built up. For the 5 qubit code
  this table is given by: $X\_1: (0,0,0,1); X\_2: (1,0,0,0); X\_3: (1,1,0,0); X\_4: (0,1,1,0); X\_5: (0,0,1,1)$,
  $Z\_1: (1,0,1,0); Z\_2: (0,1,0,1); Z\_3: (0,0,1,0); Z\_4: (1,0,0,1); Z\_5: (0,1,0,0)$ with $Y_i$ obtained by adding the $X_i$ and $Z_i$ syndromes. Note that the
  ordering in the table lookup recovery is given by converting the bitvectors to integers (using little endian).
