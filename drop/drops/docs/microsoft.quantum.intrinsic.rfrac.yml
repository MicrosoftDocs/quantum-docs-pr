uid: microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.rfrac
name: RFrac
type: operation
namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic
summary: |-
  Applies a rotation about the given Pauli axis by an angle specified
  as a dyadic fraction.

  \begin{align}
  R_{\mu}(n, k) \mathrel{:=}
  e^{i \pi n \sigma_{\mu} / 2^k},
  \end{align}
  where $\mu \in \{I, X, Y, Z\}$.

  > [!WARNING]
  > This operation uses the **opposite** sign convention from
  > @"microsoft.quantum.intrinsic.r".
remarks: |-
  Equivalent to:

  ```qsharp
  // PI() is a Q# function that returns an approximation of π.
  R(pauli, -PI() * IntAsDouble(numerator) / IntAsDouble(2 ^ (power - 1)), qubit);
  ```
syntax: 'operation RFrac (pauli : Pauli, numerator : Int, power : Int, qubit : Qubit) : Unit'
input:
  content: '(pauli : Pauli, numerator : Int, power : Int, qubit : Qubit)'
