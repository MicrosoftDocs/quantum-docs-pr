summary: |-
  Represents a reflection oracle.

  A reflection oracle, $O$, has inputs:

  - The phase $\phi$ by which to rotate the reflected subspace.
  - The qubit register on which to perform the given reflection.
remarks: |-
  This oracle $O = \boldone - (1 - e^{i \phi}) \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$
  performs a partial reflection by a phase $\phi$ about a single pure state
  $\ket{\psi}$.
syntax: newtype ReflectionOracle = ((Double, Qubit[]) => Unit is Adj + Ctl);
